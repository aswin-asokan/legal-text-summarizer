2010_S_431,the police investigated into the said complaint and submitted a report u s 173 of the code of criminal procedure for short the code.,FACTS
2010_S_431,when the said charged was read over and explained to the appellant he pleaded not guilty to the said charge and claimed trial.,FACTS
2010_S_431,in her cross examination prakashi devi stated that she has five sons that only her husband and one son named mahavir were staying with her that the other four sons were married and were not staying with her that on that night her husband was away in the fields and her son mahavir was also not present in the house.,FACTS
2010_S_431,however when confronted with her statement recorded in the fir she admitted having stated that when the appellant had come first time at around 11 30 pm and broke the outside bulbs her son woke up and went out of the house.,FACTS
2010_S_431,she also admitted that the appellant did not touch her nor teased her nor abused her.,FACTS
2010_S_431,her daughter in law sheela devi gave evidence as pw 2 and stated that she was married to one jaibir who worked in the military services that at 11 to 11 30 pm the accused scaled the door and broke the bulbs in the verandah of her house that when she identified the accused and raised an alarm the accused ran away that again he came around 00 30 am by scaling the door and caught her hand and that when she raised an alarm and when her mother in law woke up he ran away.,FACTS
2010_S_431,the special court framed a charge only for an offence u s 376 ipc and after trial convicted the respondent u s 376 ipc and sentenced him to ten years imprisonment.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,the accused concentrated his cross examination with reference to the said charge and elicited answers showing that he did not assault or outrage the modesty of prakashi devi.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,he did not try to challenge the evidence let in to show that he had tried to outrage the modesty of sheela devi as he was not charged with such an offence.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,the evidence of pw 1 and pw 2 was that the appellant did not touch or tease or abuse prakashi devi.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,when the accused is charged with having entered the house of prakashi devi and assaulted the said prakashi devi with intent to outrage her modesty and when the accused defended himself in regard to the said charge and concentrated on proving that the said charges were not true he can not be convicted for having assaulted and outraging the modesty of someone else namely sheela devi.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,the accused did not have any opportunity to meet or defend himself against the charge that he assaulted sheela devi and outraged her modesty.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,nor did he proceed with his defence on the understanding that he was being charged with having committed the offence with reference to sheela devi.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,one of the fundamental principles of justice is that an accused should know what is the charge against him so that he can build his defence in regard to that charge.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,if sheela devi alone had been present at the house at the time of the incident and the accused had assaulted and outraged the modesty of the said sheela devi but in the charge the name of the victim had been erroneously mentioned say as sushila devi or prakashi devi though there was no person by such nameand the inquiry exclusively referred to the assault and outraging the modesty of sheela devi the court could infer that the accused was not misled and the error in the charge was immaterial.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,the court having charged the accused with the offence of having trespassed into the house of prakashi devi with intent to assault her and having further charged him for having assaulted the said prakashi devi by outraging her modesty convicts him on the ground that though he did not assault or outrage the modesty of prakashi devi he had outraged the modesty of sheela devi that would lead to failure of justice.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,there was a material error in the charge as it violated the requirement of sub s 1 of s 212 of the code that the charge shall contain particulars as to the person against whom the offence was committed.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,there were two women present at the house at the time of the alleged incident namely prakashi devi and her daughter in law sheela devi.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,in view of the specific charge the accused concentrated on showing that the charge was false.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,he did not attempt to meet the case made out in the trial that the offence was against sheela devi.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,the accused was thus clearly misled by the error in the charge which caused prejudiced to the accused thereby occasioning failure of justice.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,therefore we are of the view that there should be a new trial after charging him with the offence of outraging the modesty of sheela devi.,ANALYSIS
2010_S_431,the appeal is therefore allowed the conviction of the accused is set aside and the matter is remitted to the trial court with a direction for a new trial after framing a charge by substituting the words her daughter in law sheela devi for the words abovenamed prakashi deviin the second part of the charge.,JUDGMENT

1996_B_72,the aforesaid corporation issued an advertisement for auctioning the nalban fishery for a boating complex.,FACTS
1996_B_72,the calcutta high court both the learned single judge as well as the division bench committed serious error of law in directing the receiver to take possession of nalban fishery from the state of west bengal and deliver the vacant possession of the same to the members of the sarkar family.,ANALYSIS

1996_B_72,the nalban fishery was one of the items of property in the suit for partition is not disputed.,ANALYSIS
1996_B_72,it is also not disputed that the state of west bengal though was not a party to the suit but in course of proceeding before this court by an order of the court the said state of west bengal was impleaded as a party.,ANALYSIS
1996_B_72,the aforesaid order directing impleadment of the state of west bengal as a 7 party was obviously intended for the purpose that the interest of the state and the rights of the state in relation of the state and the rights of the state in relation of the state and the rights of the state in relation to several fisheries could be protected.,ANALYSIS

1995_S_317,a 9 also put forward a similar defence while a 10 alleged that the police had instituted a false case against him at the instance of narayan dhotare according to a 11also the witnesses had deposed falsely against him at the instance of narayan dhotare.,ARGUMENT
1995_S_317,merely because the deceased and the two injured witnesses belong to wadar community no inference could be drawn that the attack by the appellants on them was intended to strike terror in a section of the society namely the wadar community.,ANALYSIS
1995_S_317,5 a 11 had alongwith the deceased accused a 1 and some others about whose identity there has been some doubt formed an unlawful assembly and in furtherance of the common object of that assembly committed the murder of popat deceased besides causing injuries to pw9 and pw14.,ANALYSIS
1995_S_317,in the result the appeal succeeds insofar as a 10 appellant no 4 is concerned.,ANALYSIS
1995_S_317,he is given the benefit of doubt and acquitted of all the charges against him.,ANALYSIS
1995_S_317,he shall be released from custody forthwith if not required in any other case.,ANALYSIS
1995_S_317,the conviction and sentence of appellants no 123 and 5 for the offence under section 3 tada is also set aside but their conviction and sentence for the other offences as recorded by the designated court is upheld and to that extent their appeals fail.,ANALYSIS
1995_S_317,2 except as aforesaid no appeal or revision shall lie to any court from any judgment sentence or order including an interlocutory order of a designated court.,STATUTE
1995_S_317,under section 12 of tada the designated court has the jurisdiction not only to try the cases under tada but also to try offences under the indian penal code if the offence under tada is connected with such other offences.,ANALYSIS
1995_S_317,the amplitude of powers available to this court under article 142 of the constitution of india is normally speaking not conditioned by any statutory provision but it can not be lost sight of that this court exercises jurisdiction under article 142 of the constitution with a view to do justice between the parties but not in disregard of the relevant statutory provisions.,ANALYSIS
1995_S_317,the transfer of the appeal to the high court after hearing the appeal on merits and finding that section 3 of tada on the basis of the evidence led by the prosecution was not made out is neither desirable nor proper nor permissible let alone justified.,ANALYSIS
1995_S_317,the submission of the learned counsel is thus devoid of merits and is consequently rejected.,JUDGMENT
1976_T_9,the high court after deciding various issues remanded the cases to the compensation officer under the act after over ruling most of the contentions pressed before it by the appellant.,FACTS

1976_T_9,the compensation officer is charged with fixing the quantum in the prescribed manner.,ANALYSIS
1976_T_9,a compensation assessment roll containing the gross asset and net income of each estate together with the compensation payable in respect of such estate has to be prepared by him.,ANALYSIS
1976_T_9,the dynamic rule of law with a social mission makes a meaningful distinction between rights steeped in the old system and compensation for deprivation of those interests on the one hand and the ordinary commercial transactions or regulation of rights untinged by social transformation urges on the other.,ANALYSIS
1976_T_9,this gives rationality to the seeming disparity.,ANALYSIS
1976_T_9,moreover the high court has rightly pointed out that the validity of section 373 of the act which fixes a small rate of interest on the compensation amount has been upheld by the supreme court in gajapati narayan 's case.,ANALYSIS
1976_T_9,presidential assent has been accorded to this state act and so the ban operates.,ANALYSIS
1976_T_9,moreover article 31a repels the applicability of articles 14 19 and 31 to the acquisition by the state of any estate or of any rights therein etc.,ANALYSIS
1976_T_9,on the other hand statutory compensation is provided for on the formula of assumed income in the previous year.,ANALYSIS
1976_T_9,similarly an assumed income tax also has to be worked out and deducted.,ANALYSIS
1976_T_9,the statutory scheme of compensation for forest lands consists of machinery for assessment of the net income which is multiplied on a sliding scale and the method of challenge to the determination by the aggrieved owner of state.,ANALYSIS
1976_T_9,the power to approve implies the power to disapprove or modify but not to report or arrive at an income de hors the forest officer 's report altogether.,ANALYSIS
1976_T_9,indeed there was a fundamental difference in the basis adopted by the forest officer and the chief conservator in the matter of assessing the income of the forests in question.,ANALYSIS
1976_T_9,it is astonishing that anyone should urge as the appellant did that the date of vesting is the last date by which the calculation of compensation should have been made and since that had not been done the compensation officer had become functus officio in awarding compensation.,ANALYSIS

2011_I_16,the high court by impugned judgment dated 03 10 2007 dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant accused and confirmed the conviction passed by the trial court.,FACTS
2011_I_16,hence the appellant accused has preferred this appeal by way of special leave petition before this court.,FACTS
2011_I_16,he fairly admitted that out of the maximum period of one year the appellant had served only 52 days in prison.,ARGUMENT
2011_I_16,with this factual position let us consider whether the request of the learned senior counsel for the appellant is to be accepted and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone.,ARGUMENT
2011_I_16,s 52 of the 1947 act mandates that any public servant who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.,STATUTE
2011_I_16,such relaxation in the form of a proviso has been done away with in the 1988 act.,STATUTE
2011_I_16,to put it clear in the 1988 act if an offence u s 7 is proved the same is punishable with imprisonment which shall be not less than six months and in the case of section 13it shall not be less than one year.,STATUTE
2011_I_16,there is no dispute as regards the date of occurrence and the date of conviction passed by the trial court and affirmed by the high court.,ANALYSIS
2011_I_16,inasmuch as the conviction on both counts have been confirmed by this court and we are confined to sentence part alone and in view of the minimum sentence prescribed u ss 7 and 13 of the act we are of the view that though long delay may be a ground for reduction of sentence in other cases the same may not be applicable to the case on hand when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.,ANALYSIS
2011_I_16,the corruption by public servants has become a gigantic problem.,ANALYSIS
2011_I_16,it has spread everywhere.,ANALYSIS

2011_I_16,by drawing our attention to art 142 of the constitution of india learned senior counsel for the appellant vehemently submitted that in order to do complete justice this court has ample power to reduce the sentence even to the extent of period already undergone or any other order which would be beneficial to the parties approaching this court.,ARGUMENT

2011_I_16,in mota ram vs state of haryana2009 12 scc 727 2009 indlaw sc 682this court while reiterating the above principles has concluded that art 142 can not be exercised to negate the statutory provisions.,ANALYSIS
2011_I_16,art 142 of the constitution vests unfettered independent jurisdiction to pass any order in public interest to do complete justice if exercise of such jurisdiction is not be contrary to any express provision of law.,ANALYSIS
2011_I_16,though the jurisdiction of this court u art 142 of the constitution of india is not in dispute we make it clear that exercise of such power would however depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.,ANALYSIS
2011_I_16,when both the trial court as also the high court have found that the charge leveled against the appellant under the act has been made out and proved by the prosecution by placing acceptable evidence.,ANALYSIS
2011_I_16,the orders do not disclose any factual details and the relevant provisions under which the accused was charged convicted and minimum sentence if any as available in the act as well as the period already undergone.,ANALYSIS
2011_I_16,ultimately it depends upon the conduct of the delinquent and the proof regarding demand and acceptance established by the prosecution.,ANALYSIS
2011_I_16,merely because the delinquent lost his job due to conviction under the act may not be a mitigating circumstance for reduction of sentence particularly when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.,ANALYSIS
2011_I_16,though art 142 of the constitution gives wider power to this court waiver of certain period as prescribed in the statute imposing lesser sentence than the minimum prescribed is not permissible.,ANALYSIS
2011_I_16,an order which this court can make in order to do complete justice between the parties must not only be consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution but also it can not even be inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the relevant statute.,ANALYSIS
2011_I_16,g in exercise of the power u art 142 of the constitution this court generally does not pass an order in contravention of or ignoring the statutory provisions nor is the power exercised merely on sympathy.,ANALYSIS
2011_I_16,h the power u art 142 of the constitution is a constitutional power and not restricted by statutory enactments.,ANALYSIS
2011_I_16,however this court would not pass any order u art 142 which would amount to supplant the substantive law applicable or ignoring statutory provisions dealing with the subject.,ANALYSIS
2011_I_16,in other words acting under article 142this court can not pass an order or grant relief which is totally inconsistent or goes against the substantive or statutory enactments pertaining to the case.,ANALYSIS

1953_L_1,a prayer was made that the widow be restrained from alienating the other properties in her possession.,FACTS
1953_L_1,the main issue in the suit was whether the widow took under the will an absolute estate or an estate like the hindu widow 's estate and whether the daughter 's interest therein was in the nature of a contingent remainder or whether she got in the properties a vested interest.,FACTS
1953_L_1,the court 's primary duty in such cases is to ascertain from the language employed by the testator what were his intentions keeping in view the surrounding circumstances his ordinary notions as a hindu in respect to devolution of his property his family relationships etc.,ANALYSIS
1953_L_1,he wished to make his daughter a fresh stock of descent so that her issue male or female may have the benefit of his property.,ANALYSIS
1953_L_1,they were the real persons whom he earmarked with certainty as the ultimate recipients of his bounty.,ANALYSIS
1953_L_1,the properties disposed of by the will and mentioned in the schedule were considerable in extent and it seems that they fetched sufficient income to enable the widow to fulfil the obligations under the will.,ANALYSIS
1953_L_1,she represents the estate in all respects and enjoys very wide power except that she can not alienate except for necessity and her necessities have to be judged on a variety of considerations.,ANALYSIS
1953_L_1,and she thus got an interest in it on the testator 's death.,ANALYSIS
1953_L_1,it was remarked that in spite of an express restriction against alienation the estate taken by section the niece was an estate such as a woman ordinarily acquires by inheritance under the hindu law which she holds in a completely representative character but is unable to alienate except in case of legal necessity and that such a construction was in accordance with the ordinary notions that a hindu has in regard to devolution of his property.,ANALYSIS
1953_L_1,varadachari j held that since in the will the gift over to the grand children was of the entire properties and not a mere gift by way of defeasance it had to be held that it indicated that the prior gift in favour of the widow was only of a limited interest.,ANALYSIS
1953_L_1,thereafter they shall pass to my grandson through my daughter.,ANALYSIS
1953_L_1,generally speaking there will be no point in making a will if what is to be given to a widow is what she would get on intestacy and cases do arise where a hindu wishes to give to his widow a more restricted estate than she would get on intestacy or a much larger estate than that.,ANALYSIS
1953_L_1,what is given must be gathered from the language of the will in the light of the surrounding circumstances.,ANALYSIS
1953_L_1,he also emphasized that the words of the gift over to the daughter as supporting his construction which was further reinforced by the words of the will limiting the widow 's estate till your lifetime and of the omission from therein of words such as nialik etc while describing the widow 's estate.,ARGUMENT

2008_S_1411,in respect of the proceedings initiated for the purpose of re allotment of the land despite a public notice the appellant did not file any objection.,FACTS
2008_S_1411,the validity and or legality of the said notice was questioned by the appellant by filing a writ petition in the high court of gujarat inter alia contending that the purported final allotment of plot no 165 in favour of the respondent no 3 and allotment of final plot no 157 in favour of the respondent no 4 were made without issuing any notice as envisaged u ss 52 and 53 of the act.,FACTS
2008_S_1411,a division bench of the high court dismissed an intra court appeal preferred thereagainst.,FACTS
2008_S_1411,a tenant having regard to the provisions of the transfer of property act or otherwise having an interest in the property can not be deprived therefrom without following the procedure established by law and without initiation of any proceedings for acquisition of land.,ARGUMENT
2008_S_1411,the tenant 's interest being distinct and separate could not have been held to be merged with the interest of the landlord either for the purpose of allotment of a final plot or otherwise in favour of the landlord.,ARGUMENT
2008_S_1411,appellant having a right over the remaining 200 sq m of the land of original plot no 178 should be allowed to continue thereupon and final allotment made in favour of the respondent no 3 to that extent should be cancelled.,ARGUMENT

2008_S_1411,shall in accordance with the prescribed procedure be summarily evicted by the appropriate authority.,STATUTE
2008_S_1411,for short the bombay rules are in pari materia with the rules.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,rule 21 of the bombay rules provides for the procedure to be followed by the town planning officer.,STATUTE
2008_S_1411,sub rule 3 of rule 21 of the bombay rules provides for serving of a special notice of at least three clear days upon the person interested in any plot or in any particular area comprised in the scheme before the town planning officer proceeds to deal in detail with the portion of the scheme relating thereto.,STATUTE
2008_S_1411,sub rule 4 makes it imperative upon the town planning officer to give all persons affected by any particular of the scheme sufficient opportunity of stating their views and shall not give any decision till he has duly considered their representations if any.,STATUTE
2008_S_1411,sub rule 5 provides for recording a brief minute setting out the points at issue and the necessary particulars if during the proceedings it appears to the town planning officer that there are conflicting claims or any difference of opinion with regard to any part of the scheme.,STATUTE
2008_S_1411,rules 26 of the rules do not contemplate service of individual notice.,STATUTE
2008_S_1411,it prescribes service of notice in form h a copy of the notice in the said form is kept at the office of the town planning officer during office hours.,STATUTE
2008_S_1411,any person affected by the proposal of the town planning scheme is entitled to inspect the scheme in the office where arrangements for explaining the scheme proposals are made.,STATUTE
2008_S_1411,a town planning scheme therefore envisages calling for objection from the persons concerned for three purposes i in regard to draft scheme ii lodging of any claim for payment of compensation iii participation in the matter of allotment of final plots.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,in jaswantsingh mathurasingh1991 indlaw sc 972 suprait was reiterated that a tenant or a sub tenant is a person interested and is entitled to notice.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,it is obvious that u s 105 of transfer of property act a lease creates right or an interest in enjoyment of the demised property and a tenant or a sub tenant is entitled to remain in possession of the demised property until the lease is duly terminated and eviction takes place in accordance with law.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,therefore a tenant or a sub tenant in possession of a tenement in the town planning scheme is a person interested within the meaning of rules 213 and 4 of the rules.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,whether irrespective of rule 26 of the rules which prescribes for issuance of a general public notice any special notice upon the appellant was required to be served by the state or by the authority in our opinion cannot be gone into by us in these proceedings for the first time.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,validity of rule 26 of the rules had never been questioned.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,it had also not been contended that the said rule is ultra vires s 52 of the act.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,a person may waive a right either expressly or by necessary implication.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,he may in a given case disentitle himself from obtaining an equitable relief particularly when he allows a thing to come to an irreversible situation.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,different statutes provide for different manner of service of notice.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,b he did not file objections for re allotment and did not participate in the proceedings following acquisition instituted by the authorities under the act.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,in view of the above the issue is whether it was open to him to assert his purported right to special notice in respect of the final allotment in the instant case given the fact that he did not pursue his objections to the draft scheme and subsequently did not object participate during the proceedings for re allotment.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,assuming however that it was obligatory for the state to issue notice to the appellant the question is whether the principle of waiver precludes him from claiming equitable relief in this case due to his earlier conduct which allowed the entire process of acquisition and allotment to become final.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,it is true that waiver can not always and in every case be inferred merely from the failure of the party to take the objection.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,waiver can be inferred only if and after it is shown that the party knew about the relevant facts and was aware of his right to take the objection.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,but if it appears that the statutory conditions were inserted by the legislature simply for the security or benefit of the parties to the action themselves and that no public interests are involved such conditions will not be considered as indispensable and either party may waive them without affecting the jurisdiction of the court.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,such conduct precludes and operates as estoppel against him with respect to asserting a right over a portion of the acquired land in a situation where the scheme in question has attained finality following as a result of the appellant 's inaction.,ANALYSIS
2008_S_1411,for the reasons aforementioned the appeal is dismissed.,JUDGMENT

1994_M_69,that suit was resisted by the defendants each of them having filed separate written statements which in sub stance did not differ from each other.,FACTS
1994_M_69,the defence in those written statements was that defendant l and his family members had become tenants of the suit properties in the year 1959 1960 and had continued to be such tenants at the time of mortgage deeds executed in respect of those properties in the year 1961 and thereafter.,FACTS
1994_M_69,such findings were firstly that the defendants had failed to prove that the suit properties were sold in favour of defendant l subsequent to the giving of security of those properties in his favour under the mortgage deeds secondly that the defendants had failed to prove the past tenancy of the suit properties on its view that what was pleaded by them in the written statements was tenancy prior to the date of filing of the suit and thirdly that the mortgages of the suit properties were mortgages by conditional sale.,FACTS
1994_M_69,in any event it was not the case of the plaintiff that defendant l was a tenant of the suit properties and hc surrendered his possession of the suit properties either expressly or impliedly and the possession so obtained by the plaintiff was re delivered to defendant l in pursuance of the mortgages by conditional sale executed in his favour.,ANALYSIS

1994_M_69,section 70 of the bt al act to which we have adverted already imposes a duty on the mamlatdar to decide whether a person is an agriculturist or a tenant or a protected tenant or a permanent tenant when such person claims to be so under that act.,ANALYSIS
1994_M_69,further section 85 of the bt al act to which also we have already adverted in unequivocal terms says that in deciding any issue which is required to be decided by the mamlatdar under the bt al act no civil court has jurisdiction to decide it.,ANALYSIS
1994_M_69,furthermore section 85a as it stood prior to its amendment by gujarat amendment act no 5 in the year 1973 and as stands thereafter requires that if any suit instituted in civil court involves the question of tenancy of present or pastas the case may be the same being required to be decided or dealt with by an authority competent under the bt al act the civil court has to stay the suit and refer the issue to such competent authority for determination and after receiving the decision thereon to dispose of the suit in accordance with such decision.,ANALYSIS
1994_M_69,thus the provisions in the bt al act give no scope or room to think that the plea of tenancy if raised by the defendants in a suit in a civil court the same could be decided by the civil court.,ANALYSIS

2015_S_368,thereafter the appellant filed letters patent appeal which was also dismissed by the division bench holding that when the state minister for revenue entertained the matter he was possessed of jurisdiction under section 257 of the maharashtra land revenue code and therefore the order passed by him under the said authority is within his jurisdiction power and competence.,FACTS
2015_S_368,referring the decision of the bombay high court in the case of sambappa vs state of maharashtra 2002 scc on line bombay 1222learned counsel submitted that when the sub divisional officer additional collector and additional commissioner had concurrently recorded finding in favour of the appellant by observing that the revenue record is not in consonance with the factual aspect and they have directed to correct the revenue entries in such a case the second revisional authority exceeded its jurisdiction in entertaining the said application and interfering with the finding of fact.,ARGUMENT
2015_S_368,section 257 makes it clear that a revisional authority has to consider only the legality and propriety of the decision.,ARGUMENT
2015_S_368,learned counsel referring the revisional jurisdiction of the high court under section 115 of the code of civil procedure tried to impress us that when the power of revision is given to the district judge then the high court can not entertain second revision petition under section 115 of the code.,ARGUMENT

2015_S_368,section 11 provides that all revenue officers shall be subordinate to the state government.,ANALYSIS
2015_S_368,it is therefore clear that in revenue matters the state government is the supreme revenue authority.,ANALYSIS
2015_S_368,the power of revision exercised by any revenue officer including the commissioner is a proceeding by a subordinate officer and the state government can satisfy itself as to the legality and propriety of any decision including the order passed in revision by the revenue officers.,ANALYSIS
2015_S_368,there is nothing in the code to suggest that if these revisional powers are exercised by a revenue officer who has jurisdiction it can not be further exercised by a superior revenue officer or by the state government.,ANALYSIS
2015_S_368,therefore under chapter xiii a clear distinction is made between the state government and the registrar.,ANALYSIS
2015_S_368,the test is whether the two authorities with concurrent revisional jurisdiction are equal in rank.,ANALYSIS
2015_S_368,it is therefore not correct as contended by learned counsel for the appellant that the two authorities i e the state government and the registrar are interchangeable.,ANALYSIS
2015_S_368,the power of the government and the registrar in terms of section 128 excludes matters which are covered by section 125 i e revision by the tribunal.,ANALYSIS
2015_S_368,the division bench of the bombay high court has elaborately discussed the question and passed the impugned order holding that section 257 confers jurisdiction to the state government to entertain its revision against the order passed by any revenue officer either in appeal or in revision.,JUDGMENT
2015_S_368,hence this appeal has no merit which is accordingly dismissed.,JUDGMENT

1971_S_1,on a careful consideration of the evidence both oral and documentary it is established that the appellant who was in charge of the expansion work on the air strip was given possession of the land acquired for that purpose on 13 2 63 that there was standing thereon a bumper crop of sarson gram and lusan on that day that he was therefore entrusted with this crop that he postponed giving delivery of the land to the contractor till at any rate after the 23rd march 1963 and before the 6th april 1963 and that he allowed the crop to be cut and taken away without in any way accounting for it which shows that it was done dishonestly and raudulently.,JUDGMENT
1971_S_1,the fact that otwithstanding overwhelming evidence particularly of his own admission at the time he denies that there were ever any crops when delivery of possession of the land acquired was taken by him further reinforces the conclusion that he allowed the crops to be cut away with dishonest or fraudulent motive.,JUDGMENT
2000_V_80,the appellant is a company incorporated under the companies act1956 with the object of manufacture and sale of cigarettes.,FACTS
2000_V_80,members of general public are the shareholders and the shares of the company are traded in through various stock exchanges in the country.,FACTS
2000_V_80,a petition was filed under article 226 of the constitution by respondent no 1 seeking for a writ of mandamus to treat the members of the respondent union who are employees working in the canteen of the appellants factory as employees of the appellant and for grant of monetary and other consequential benefits.,FACTS
2000_V_80,therefore when that work is got done through somebody else by providing the necessary infrastructure and other facilities when the personnel did not change though the contractors changed from time to time he held that they become employees of the appellant.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,on appeal the division bench of the high court affirmed the view taken by the learned single judge.,FACTS
2000_V_80,what is relevant is the nature of the duty imposed on that body.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,the duty must be judged in the light of positive obligation owed by the person or authority to the affected party no matter by what means the duty is imposed.,FACTS
2000_V_80,on that basis the division bench of the high court dismissed the writ appeal.,FACTS
2000_V_80,hence this appeal.,FACTS
2000_V_80,on behalf of the respondent heavy reliance was placed on this decision and also the decision of the high court in t gattaiahs case to contend that in running a canteen under section 46 of the act the appellant was discharging a public duty and therefore a writ of mandamus would lie against it.,ARGUMENT
2000_V_80,2 the principles of judicial review prima facie govern the activities of bodies performing public functions.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,however not all decisions taken by bodies in the course of their public functions are the subject matter of judicial review.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,in such a case the express or implied terms of the agreement should normally govern the matter.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,thus where a special method of resolving disputes such as arbitration or resolution by private or domestic tribunals has been agreed by the parties expressly or by necessary implicationthat regime and not judicial review will normally govern the dispute.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,the high court has relied very strongly on the decision of a learned single judge in t gattaiahs case wherein it was stated that a writ may lie under article 226 of the constitution against a company incorporated under the companies act1956 as it is permissible to issue a writ against any person.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,in anadi muktas case this court examined the various aspects and the distinction between an authority and a person and after analysis of the decisions referred in that regard came to the conclusion that it is only in the circumstances when the authority or the person performs a public function or discharges a public duty article 226 of the constitution can be invoked.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,in the present case the appellant is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,manufacture and sale of cigarettes will not involve any public function.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,incidental to that activity there is an obligation under section 46 of the act to set up a canteen when the establishment has more than 250 workmen.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,that means it is a condition of service in relation to a workman providing better facilities to workmen to discharge their duties properly and maintain their own health or welfare.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,that the management exercises control over the standard in quality quantity and the rate of the food items supplied to the workmen for whose benefit the canteen is established.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,thus these circumstances clearly indicate that the appellant has a complete control over the activities in respect of the canteen and the contractor has absolutely no discretion either in regard to the menu quality and quantity of the food items much less the rate at which the same are supplied to the workmen.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,when the management of the appellant exercises such a complete control the canteen shall be deemed to be run by the management itself.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,the appellant in any manner can not controvert these facts.,ANALYSIS
2000_V_80,no costs.,JUDGMENT
2000_V_80,w 49 was stated to be contradictory to the stand taken by the workmen all through.,ARGUMENT

2015_J_10,first accused jage ram pleaded that on the date of occurrence complainant party jagdish and his sons mange ram and sukhbir forcibly trespassed into the land belonging to the accused and attempted to forcibly cut the pullas.,FACTS
2015_J_10,jagdish further claims that he along with rakesh caused injuries to the complainant party in exercise of right of private defence of property.,FACTS
2015_J_10,307 ipc.,ARGUMENT
2015_J_10,additionally the learned counsel contended that the defence plea of private defence was not considered by the courts below in proper perspective.,ARGUMENT
2015_J_10,evidence of pws 5 and 6 is amply corroborated by medical evidence.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,cogent and convincing grounds are required to discard the evidence of injured witnesses.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,in the light of the fact that pws 5 and 6 were injured witnesses courts below tested their evidence for its credibility and recorded concurrent findings that pws 5 and 6 are trustworthy witnesses.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,for the purpose of conviction section 307 ipc prosecution has to establish i the intention to commit murder and ii the act done by the accused.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,the burden is on the prosecution that accused had attempted to commit the murder of the prosecution witness.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,to justify a conviction section 307 ipc it is not essential that fatal injury capable of causing death should have been caused.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,although the nature of injury actually caused may be of assistance in coming to a finding as to the intention of the accused such intention may also be adduced from other circumstances.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,the intention of the accused is to be gathered from the circumstances like the nature of the weapon used words used by the accused at the time of the incident motive of the accused parts of the body where the injury was caused and the nature of injury and severity of the blows given etc.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,it is sufficient to justify a conviction section 307 if there is present an intent coupled with some overt act in execution thereof.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,it is not essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,the section makes a distinction between the act of the accused and its result if any.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,therefore an accused charged section 307 ipc can not be acquitted merely because the injuries inflicted on the victim were in the nature of a simple hurt.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,307 ipc is unassailable.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,for the conviction section 307 ipc courts below imposed upon the 2nd appellant rigorous imprisonment of five years while imposing punishment courts have an obligation to award appropriate punishment.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,question of awarding sentence is a matter of discretion and the same has to be exercised by the courts taking into consideration all the relevant circumstances.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,what sentence would meet the ends of justice would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case and the courts must keep in mind the gravity of the offence motive for the crime nature of the offence and all other attendant circumstances.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,having regard to the fact that the occurrence was of the year 1994 considering the other facts and circumstances of the case the sentence of imprisonment imposed on jage ram a 1 madan a 3 and rakesh a 4 is reduced to the period already undergone by them.,ANALYSIS
2015_J_10,the conviction of a 1 section 325 ipc a 3 and a 4 section 323 ipc is confirmed and the sentence is reduced to the period already undergone by each of them.,JUDGMENT
2015_J_10,307 ipc is confirmed and the sentence of imprisonment of five years is reduced to the period already undergone and additionally the second accused shall pay a compensation of rs 750000 to the injured witness sukhbir.,JUDGMENT
2015_J_10,compensation amount of rs 500000 deposited in this court by the 2nd appellant shall be paid to the injured witness sukhbir.,JUDGMENT

2007_S_608,for about six months bhimabai was treated well but thereafter the accused started asking her to bring rs 1000 1200 from her parents to meet the household expenses and also for purchasing manure.,FACTS
2007_S_608,pw 1 then immediately went to the house of the accused along with some of his relatives.,FACTS
2007_S_608,there he saw that bhimabai was lying dead and froth was coming out of her mouth which indicated that she had consumed some poisonous substance.,FACTS
2007_S_608,after completion of investigation charge sheet was submitted against the appellants and in due course the case was committed to the court of sessions.,FACTS
2007_S_608,the appellants pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.,FACTS
2007_S_608,the viscera were preserved for chemical analysis.,FACTS
2007_S_608,p c which was recorded on the very next day of the death of bhimabai this witness did not state that the cause for ill treatment was a demand for money and a consequent beating.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_608,the evidence on record does not indicate that the police had any reason to favour the accused and deliberately omitted to mention about the alleged demand of money while recording the statement of pw 5 sumanbai under section 161 cr.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_608,the evidence shows that the accused come from very humble background and they could not have exerted any kind of influence financial or otherwise upon the police so as to manage a statement favourable to them when in the course of investigation the statements of witnesses were being recorded under section 161 cr.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_608,two essential ingredient of section 304 b ipc apart from others are i death of women is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances and ii women is subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for or in connection with any demand for dowry.,STATUTE
2007_S_608,in view of the aforesaid definition of the word dowry any property or valuable security should be given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly at or before or any time after the marriage and in connection with the marriage of the said parties.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_608,therefore the giving or taking of property or valuable security must have some connection with the marriage of the parties and a correlation between the giving or taking of property or valuable security with the marriage of the parties is essential.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_608,since an essential ingredient of section 304 b ipc viz demand for dowry is not established the conviction of the appellants can not be sustained.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_608,the appeal before the high court and also in this court has been preferred by the appellants challenging their conviction under section 304 b read with section 34 ipc.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_608,the appellant no 1 is in custody.,JUDGMENT

1989_A_55,he made representation to the additional chief engineer for cancelling his transfer order on the ground that his mother aged 70 years was ailing and it would cause great inconvenience to him if he was required to join at ukai.,FACTS
1989_A_55,his representation was rejected and he was directed to join at ukai but he did not do so instead he filed a civil suit at baroda challenging validity of the order of transfer.,FACTS
1989_A_55,transfer of a government servant appointed to a particular cadre of transferable posts from one place to the other is an incident of service.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,no government servant or employee of public undertaking has legal tight for being posted at any particular place.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,transfer from one place to other is generally a condition of service and the employee has no choice in the matter.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,transfer from one place to other is necessary in public interest and efficiency in the public administration.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,whenever a public servant is transferred he must comply with the order but if there be any genuine difficulty in proceeding on transfer it is open to him to make representation to the competent authority for stay modification or cancellation of the transfer order.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,if the order of transfer is not stayed modified or cancelled the concerned public servant must carry out the order of transfer.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,in the absence of any stay of the transfer order a public servant has no justification to avoid or evade the transfer order merely on the ground of having made a representation or on the ground of his difficulty in moving from one place to the other.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,if he fails to proceed on transfer in compliance to the transfer order he would expose himself to disciplinary action under the relevant rules as has happened in the instant case.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,the respondent lost his service as he refused to comply with the order of his transfer from one place to the other.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,there is no dispute that the respondent was holding a transferable post and under the conditions of service applicable to him he was liable to be transferred and posted at any place within the state of gujarat.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,the respondent had no legal or statutory right to insist for being posted at one particular place.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,in fact during the tenure of his service in the board the respondent had been transferred from one place to another place several times.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,in march1974 he was transferred from surat to ukai.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,the distance between the two places as was stated before us during the hearing of the case is less than 50 kms.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,the above rule provides that if an employee of the gujarat electricity board continues to remain absent from duty or overstays the period of sanctioned leave and in spite of warning he fails to return to duty he renders himself liable to be discharged summarily from service without complying with the procedure prescribed for taking disciplinary action under the gujarat electricity board conduct discipline and appeal procedure.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,regulation 113 confers wide powers on the authorities to summarily discharge an employee from service if he continues to be absent from duty in an unauthorised manner and refuses to join his duty even after warning.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,the object and purpose of giving warning is to remind the delinquent employee that if he continues to be absent from duty he would be liable to action under regulation 113 and to afford him an opportunity to make amends by joining his duty.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,if even thereafter he fails to join duty his services are liable to be terminated by an order of discharge.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,the aforesaid documents leave no room for any doubt that the respondent was reminded of his failure to join his duties at ukai and he was further reminded that his unauthorised absence had exposed him to disciplinary action.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,in fact the superintending engineer had by his letter dated 18th april1974 clearly reminded the respondent that his unauthorised absence was in breach of service regulation no 113 and called upon to show cause why action should not be taken against him but in spite of these letters the respondent failed to join his duties.,ANALYSIS
1989_A_55,the respondent has been paid a sum of rs 104170 towards salary under the interim orders of this court.,JUDGMENT
1989_A_55,now since the order of discharge is held to be valid the amount paid to the respondent is liable to be recovered from him but having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and the hardship which could be caused to the respondent we direct the appellant not to recover the amount already paid to the respondent.,JUDGMENT

1973_S_68,it was the appellant 's case that he had been in occupation of the said 160 acres of cherikkal land unregistered dry lands in hilly tracts about which and the adjoining lands there was a dispute as to whether the same belonged to a jenmi family known as koodalvalli illom hereinafter called the illom or to the government of the erstwhile travancore state.,FACTS
1973_S_68,in the bona fide belief that the lands belonged to the illom.,FACTS
1973_S_68,it was stated that according to the practice prevailing in the erstwhile state of travancore the cultivators could enter into unoccupied waste lands belonging to the janmies with the object of cultivating and improving them and as they held the lands under them by paying rent the consent of the jemies to such occupation was implied.,FACTS
1973_S_68,from the lands from which he was evicted he would be entitled to claim compensation for the improvements made by him.,ARGUMENT
1973_S_68,this finding is fortified by section 5 of the act which provides that from and after the commencement of the act it shall not be lawful for any person to occupy land which is the property of the government whether poramboke or not without the permission from the government or such officer of the government as may be empowered in that behalf.,ANALYSIS
1973_S_68,in view of this specific provision the contravention of which is punishable under section 6 thereof his conduct in applying for registration and for getting himself impleaded in the suit of the illom against the government would show that he knew that the land was government land or land in which the government had a claim.,ANALYSIS
1973_S_68,forfeiture under this section shall be disposed of as the division peishkar may direct.,STATUTE
1973_S_68,at the time of the distress the sum of pound 281 6 section was due from the plaintiffs to the defendant for rent in respect of the nursery ground.,ANALYSIS
1973_S_68,the question before the court was whether the plaintiffs were entitled to recover against the defendant damages caused to them by cutting down and carrying away the plaintiffs trees.,ANALYSIS
1973_S_68,with those specified in that section to all of which the process of becoming ripe and of being cut gathered made and laid up when ripe was incidental.,ANALYSIS
1973_S_68,in our view therefore trees are not included within the meaning of other products raised on the land in section 9 of the act and there is therefore no obligation on the government to give notice of forfeiture under that section.,ANALYSIS
1973_S_68,appeal dismissed.,JUDGMENT
1980_W_3,its work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen.,FACTS
1980_W_3,it was urged that the efficiency bar as a feature of the wage scales should be removed.,FACTS
1980_W_3,the dearness allowance it was claimed should be granted on a slab system.,FACTS
1980_W_3,the claim of the union was resisted by the appellant who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region cum industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the union were accepted.,FACTS
1980_W_3,the appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised.,FACTS
1980_W_3,there was no separate dearness allowance until january1977 when it was introduced for the first time.,FACTS
1980_W_3,house rent allowance was also paid.,FACTS
1980_W_3,dearness allowance became payable at 10 of the basic wage subject to a minimum of rs 50 and house rent allowance at 30 of the basic salary.,FACTS
1980_W_3,the tribunal took note of the elaborate scales of wages already existing in the wage structure of the appellant and decided to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category.,FACTS
1980_W_3,two days after the award was made an application was made by the union stating in the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance.,FACTS
1980_W_3,one is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of rs 150 in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd december1978.,ARGUMENT
1980_W_3,considering the appeal of tata consulting engineers first the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and in any event in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st january1976.,ARGUMENT
1980_W_3,it must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,no dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,the cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and as the tribunal has found the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,during all these years the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant 's growing prosperity.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,they are considerations which can not be ignored.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,accordingly the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,it is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of rs 150 to each workman in the case of draughtsman and rs 100 to each workman in the case of other categories a result wholly unwarranted it is said by the intent of the original award and therefore falling beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal.,ARGUMENT
1980_W_3,the jurisdiction given to the tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,it is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,an accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,it must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,it must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,the financial capacity of the appellant and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977were examined from that view point.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,the sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,for the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,the financial capacity as the tribunal observed constituted one of the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,no ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,it will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,individual workmen were not present to the mind of the tribunal.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,that the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,the comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,no second flat increase was envisaged at all.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,the amendment made by the tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,if as the tribunal has stated in the amendment order the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,there will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by rs 150 in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,considering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,conspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,the only contention of the workmen is that the tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index.,ARGUMENT
1980_W_3,reliance was placed on the hindustan times ltd new delhi v their workmen 1964 1 scr 234 1962 indlaw sc 436247 where it was observed by this court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,it was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,if the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,the award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales larger increments longer span of 20 years for earning increments dearness allowance at 10 of the basic wage besides several other benefits have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,it is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,there is no order as to costs.,JUDGMENT
1980_W_3,in the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance.,FACTS
1980_W_3,the omission of the words to each employee first after the figure rs 150 and again after the figure rs 100 was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the tribunal was entitled to correct.,ANALYSIS
1980_W_3,the tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the tribunal.,ANALYSIS

2001_A_234,yeh jo hai zindagi had gained popularity and had become one of the most exclusive and popular serial.,FACTS
2001_A_234,the petitioners claimed that the exclusive right to use the title thereof belonged to them and the 2nd episode of yeh jo hai zindagi was telecast without the name of the petitioners being mentioned as sponsors nor was their advertisement shown.,FACTS
2001_A_234,further the said respondents had been recovering the cost of production well in advance of the serial episodes being actually produced.,FACTS
2001_A_234,some time in may 1985the 1st respondent proposed to the petitioners that some other products should be tied up with the serial yeh jo hai zindagi.,FACTS
2001_A_234,however the petitioners were not interested in the same as they wanted the serial to project their products only exclusively and did not agree to any other products being tied up with the said serial.,FACTS

2001_A_234,however the titles continued to show mr s s oberoi as the producer of the serial and the petitioners did not withhold payments.,ANALYSIS
2001_A_234,the aggregate amount of rs 76 50 lakhs which was paid to the respondents for 60 episodes is not the amount for cost of production but the fixed price for sponsoring the said serial in order to link up their advertisement with the serial and avail substantial benefit of concessional rate under the scheme envisaged by doordarshan.,ANALYSIS

2006_A_136,although in relation to a body corporate incorporated and registered under the indian companies act the doctrine of lifting the corporate veil would be applicable but the same can not be applied in case of individuals.,ARGUMENT
2006_A_136,ii having regard to the fact that only three entitles out of eight were involved in the offences the liability of harshad mehta could not have been clubbed for the purpose of directing attachment and consequent sale of the properties which exclusively belong to them.,ARGUMENT
2006_A_136,the liabilities of harshad mehta who was a sui generis could have been recovered from the properties held and possessed by him or from the companies floated by him but not from the individual entities at least two of whom being medical practitioners have their income from other sources.,ARGUMENT

2006_A_136,the act.,FACTS
2006_A_136,it also provides for appointment of one or more custodians for attaching the property of the offenders with a view to prevent diversion of such properties by the offenders.,STATUTE
2006_A_136,the act provides for stringent measures.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,it was enacted for dealing with an extra ordinary situation in the sense that any person who was involved in any offence relating to transaction of any security may be notified whereupon all his properties stand attached.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,the provision contained in the act being stringent in nature the purport and intent thereof must be ascertained having regard to the purpose and object it seeks to achieve.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,but at the stage when liabilities are required to be discharged the notified person may inter alia raise a contention inter alia for the purpose of establishing that the properties held and possessed by them are sufficient to meet their liabilities.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,in terms of the provisions of the act the special court had been conferred a very wide power.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,such attachment being automatic no finding was required to be arrived at that the same had been acquired either during the notified period or the appellants were involved in offences in transactions in securities.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,the courts must interpret the law as it reads.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,while a purposive interpretation is permissible where two interpretations are possible the purposive interpretation must be such as preserves the constitutionality of the provision.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,it would not be proper for us to consider as to whether such a remedy being not available in terms of section 42 of the act can still be determined if raised by way of defence.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,we are therefore of the opinion that the provisions of the limitation act have no application so far as directions required to be issued by the special court relating to the disposal of attached property are concerned.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,for the said purpose it is not necessary that they should be accused of commission of an offence as such.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,the principle of lifting the corporate veil however ipso facto would not apply to the individuals.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,the custodian in a case of this nature may however show that the transactions entered into apparently by harshad mehta were intimately connected with acquisition of properties in the name of others.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,a transaction of benami indisputably can be a subject matter of a lies in terms of section 41 of the act as and when such a question is raised the same may have to be dealt with by the special court appropriately.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,however nexus between several persons in dealing with the matter may be established by the custodian.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,the fact however remains that the copies of the documents books of accounts and other records on the basis whereof the auditors appointed by the court filed their reports had not been shown to the appellants herein on the premise that they were in know of the things.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,as the said question has not been gone into by the learned judge special court it is necessary that the same be considered and appropriately dealt with.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,if the liabilities of the individual entities are not treated as that of the group for one reason or the other indisputably liability of those who have nothing to do with the dealings of harshad mehta either in their individual capacities or as directors of some company or otherwise must be dealt with separately.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,a finding of fact arrived at upon discussing and analyzing the respective contentions could have gone a long way in assisting this court in arriving at a correct conclusion.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,the learned judge proceeded on the basis that the assets and liabilities joint and collective of all those who are related with harshad mehta as also the corporate entities in which he was a director or had some other interest must be considered as a group.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,even in this behalf it was necessary for the special judge to assign sufficient and cogent reasons.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,it was thus necessary for the learned special court to arrive at a firm conclusion as regard the involvement of the individuals with harshad mehta if any and the extent of his liability as such.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,furthermore the question as regard liability of the parties should have been determined at the stage of section 9 a of the act.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,it is not possible to comprehend how the liability would cease to be one because the assessee had taken proceedings before higher authorities for getting it reduced or wiped out so long as the contention of the assessee did not prevail with regard to the quantum of liability etc.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,in a case of this nature when the court accepts its own mistake in understanding the nature and purport of the undertaking given by the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the board and its correlation with as to what transpired in the agm of the board held on 29 9 2004 the subsequent event may be taken into consideration by the court for the purpose of rectifying its own mistake.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_136,despite the fact that ordinarily a sale can be set aside only under rules 89 90 and 91 of order xxxi it was opined that the court is bound to confirm the sale and direct the grant of a certificate vesting the title in the purchaser as from the date of sale when no application in term of rule 92 was made or when such application was made and disallowed and in support thereof zain ul abdin khan 1887 indlaw pc 13 supra and various other decisions were referred to.,ANALYSIS

1987_C_108,in the case of subordinate legislation it may happen that parliament may itself provide for a notice and for a hearing there are several instances of the legislature requiring the subordinate legislating authority to give public notice and a public hearing before say for example levying a municipal rate in which case the substantial non observance of the statutorily prescribed mode of observing natural justice may have the effect of invalidating the subordinate legislation.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,any attempt to draw a distinct line between legislative and administrative functions it has been said is difficult in theory and impossible in practice.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,a price fixation measure does not concern itself with the interests of an individual manufacturer or producer.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,it is generally in relation to a particular commodity or class of commodities or transactions.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,it is a direction of a general character not directed against a particular situation.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,it is conceived in the interests of the general consumer public.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,the right of the citizen to obtain essential articles at fair prices and the duty of the state to so provide them are transformed into the power of the state to fix prices and the obligation of the producer to charge n6 more than the price fixed.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,viewed from whatever angle the angle of general application the prospectivity of its effect the public interest served and the rights and obligations flowing therefrom there can be no question that price fixation is ordinarily a legislative activity.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,pricefixation may occasionally assume an administrative or quasi judicial character when it relates to acquisition or requisition of goods or property from individuals and it becomes necessary to fix the price separately in relation to such individuals.,ANALYSIS

1987_C_108,one of the terms of reference was to examine the measures taken so far to reduce prices of drugs for the consumer and to recommend such further measures as may be necessary to rationalise the prices of basic drugs and formulations.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,the hathi committee noticed that in a country like india where general poverty and the wide disparities in levels of income between different sections existed it was particularly important to emphasise the social utility of the industry and the urgent need for extending as rapidly as possible certain minimum facilities in terms of preventive and curative medicines to the large mass of people both urban and rural.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,order was abandoned in the 1979 order.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,bulk drugs were however broadly divided into indigenously manufactured bulk drugs imported bulk drugs and hulk drugs which were both manufactured indigenously as also imported.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,order was a legislative activity and therefore not subject to any principle of natural justice.,ARGUMENT
1987_C_108,order is not a legislative activity but a quasi judicial activity which would attract the observance of the principles of natural justice.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,nor is there anything in the scheme or the provisions of the drugs prices control order which otherwise contemplates the observance of any principle of natural justice or kindred rule the non observance of which would give rise to a cause of action to a suitor.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,what the order does contemplate however is such enquiry by the government as it thinks fit.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,the primary object of the enquiry is to secure the bulk drug at a fair price for the benefit of the ultimate consumer an object designed to fulfil the mandate of article 39b of the constitution.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,it is primarily from the consumer public 's point of view that the government is expected to make its enquiry.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,the need of the consumer public is to be ascertained and making the drug available to them at a fair price is what it is all about.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,the enquiry is to be made from that angle and directed towards that end.,ANALYSIS

1987_C_108,it may also be questioned on any ground on which a subordinate legislation may be questioned such as being contrary to constitutional or other statutory provisions.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,it may be questioned on the ground of a denial of the right guaranteed by article 14 if it is arbitrary that is if either the guidelines prescribed for the determination are arbitrary or if even though the guidelines are not arbitrary the guidelines are worked in an arbitrary fashion.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,these are not matters for investigation in a petition under article 226 of the constitution or under article 32 of the constitution.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,despite the pressing invitation of shri diwan to go into facts and figures and his elaborate submissions based on facts and figures we have carefully and studiously refrained from making any reference to such facts and figures as we consider it outside our province to do so and we do not want to set any precedent as was supposed to have been done in premier automobiles though it was not so done and therefore needed explanation in later cases.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,this is also a question which may be raised before the government in the review application.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,it was open to the subordinate legislating body to prescribe and adopt its own mode of ascertaining the cost of production and the items to be included and excluded in so doing.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,the subordinate legislating body was under no obligation to adopt the method adopted by the income tax authorities in allowing expenses for the purpose of ascertaining income and assessing it.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,there may be many items of business expenditure which may be allowed by income tax authorities as legitimate expenses but which can never enter the cost of production.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,so long as the method prescribed and adopted by the subordinate legislating body is not arbitrary and opposed to the principal statutory provisions it can not be legitimately questioned.,ANALYSIS
1987_C_108,a general submission of the learned counsel was that the price of formulations should not have been prescribed until the review application filed by the manufacturer in regard to the patent bulk drugs was disposed of.,ARGUMENT
1987_C_108,any information sought by the manufacturer may be given to him at the hearing in terms of what we have said in the judgment.,ANALYSIS

2011_S_308,the state government explained that this was done in view of the pressing urgency in the matter of construction of the jails.,FACTS
2011_S_308,being aggrieved by the aforesaid notifications the appellants moved a writ petition before the high court u art 226 of the constitution of india.,FACTS
2011_S_308,committee was formed matter was discussed at a leisurely pace at various levels and there is no material fact to justify the abridgement of the appellants right of raising an objection to acquisition and of a hearing under section 5a of the act.,ARGUMENT
2011_S_308,in connection with land acquisition proceeding whenever the provision of s 17 and its various sub sections including s 174 is used in the name of taking urgent or emergent action and the right of hearing of the land holder under section 5a is dispensed with the court is called upon to consider a few fundamentals in the exercise of such powers.,ANALYSIS
2011_S_308,the concept of public purpose can not remain static for all time to come.,ANALYSIS
2011_S_308,the concept even though sought to be defined u s 3f of the act is not capable of any precise definition.,ANALYSIS
2011_S_308,the said definition having suffered several amendments has assumed the character of an inclusive one.,ANALYSIS
2011_S_308,it must be accepted that in construing public purpose a broad and overall view has to be taken and the focus must be on ensuring maximum benefit to the largest number of people.,ANALYSIS
2011_S_308,any attempt by the state to acquire land by promoting a public purpose to benefit a particular group of people or to serve any particular interest at the cost of the interest of a large section of people especially of the common people defeats the very concept of public purpose.,ANALYSIS
2011_S_308,even though the concept of public purpose was introduced by pre constitutional legislation its application must be consistent with the constitutional ethos and especially the chapter under fundamental rights and also the directive principles.,ANALYSIS
2011_S_308,by judicial interpretation the contents of these part iii rights are constantly expanded.,ANALYSIS
2011_S_308,the meaning of public purpose in acquisition of land must be judged on the touchstone of this expanded view of part iii rights.,ANALYSIS
2011_S_308,the courts must examine these questions very carefully when little indians lose their small property in the name of mindless acquisition at the instance of the state.,ANALYSIS
2011_S_308,if public purpose can be satisfied by not rendering common man homeless and by exploring other avenues of acquisition the courts before sanctioning an acquisition must in exercise of its power of judicial review focus its attention on the concept of social and economic justice.,ANALYSIS
2011_S_308,while examining these questions of public importance the courts especially the higher courts cannot afford to act as mere umpires.,ANALYSIS
2011_S_308,the object of this bill is to provide that a local government shall not declare u s 6 of the act that any land is needed for a public purpose unless time has been allowed after the notification u s 4 for persons interested in the land to put in objections and for such objections to be considered by the local government.,STATUTE
2011_S_308,the construction of jail is certainly in public interest and for such construction land may be acquired.,ANALYSIS
2011_S_308,but such acquisition can be made only by strictly following the mandate of the said act.,ANALYSIS

1987_S_26,the appellant claimed to be the tenant in respect of the two premises which are quite adjacent to each other one of which is involved in this appeal.,FACTS
1987_S_26,the main controversy was whether the appellant had sublet the premises to defendant no 2bharat neon signs or whether he being a partner of the said firm had permitted the said firm to use the premises in question.,FACTS
1987_S_26,another partnership deed being exhibit 69 came to be executed among the six persons and the father of the appellant girdharlal.,FACTS
1987_S_26,but thereafter when the partnership deed exhibit 69 was executed the appellant and his father joined the firm with an agreement to share profits only and their share was fixed at 0 03 paise in a rupee.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,september1961 at this time the share of the appellant was fixed at 0 03 paise in a rupee to share the profits only.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,it is well settled that if there was such a partnership firm of which the appellant was a partner as a tenant the same would not amount to subletting leading to the forfeiture of the tenancy.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,the landlord had alleged that the appellant had closed that business and he was not using the premises in question for the purpose for which it was let to him.,FACTS
1987_S_26,it was further alleged by the landlord that the appellant had unlawfully sublet the major part of the premises in question of both the suits to defendant nos 2 to 5 in the original suit and these defendants were running business in partnership for manufacturing of neon signs in the name of bharat neon signs.,FACTS
1987_S_26,he has stated further that the suit premises were to be used for business and he could use it for any business and he joined in partnership with defendants nos 2 to 5 somewhere in 1961 to prepare neon signs and the defendants nos 2 to 5 were his partners and doing business in the suit premises.,ARGUMENT
1987_S_26,it is further stated that he had filed a civil suit to dissolve the partnership and to take account and his suit was pending in city civil court.,ARGUMENT
1987_S_26,1 the entire work of our partnership has to be carried out in the name of bharat neon signs.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,2 the work to be carried out by our partnership is of manufacturing and selling neon signs tubes and of obtaining orders therefore.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,3 whatever moneys that may be required to be invested in our partnership are to be invested by the parties of the first second third fourth and seventh parts out of us and the interest at the rate of 712 per cent per annum has to be paid for the moneys that may be invested in this partnership.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,unless the statute conferring the right to appeal limits the re hearing in some way.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,the power to hear a revision is generally given to a superior court so that it may satisfy itself that a particular case is decided according to law.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,in this view in our opinion the ambit of the power was expressed in rather wide amplitude.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,it must be such a decision which no reasonable man could have arrived at.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,lastly such a decision does not lead to a miscarriage of justice.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,if a possible view has been taken the high court would be exceeding its jurisdiction to substitute its own view with that the courts below because it considers it to be a better view.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,the fact that the high court would have taken a different view is wholly irrelevant.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,the authority vested in the high court under the amendment still remained only in the domain of the jurisdiction and power of revision and no further.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,the amending provision therefore only related to procedure and not to any rights of the parties.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,sharing of profits and contributing to losses were not the only elements in a partnership existence of agency was essential and whether there was a partnership or not is a mixed question of law and fact depending upon the varying circumstances in different cases.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,such a view was not an impossible one or a perverse one.,ANALYSIS
1987_S_26,if that was so there was nothing that could be clone about such a view within the ambit and scope of the power of section 292 of the rent act.,ANALYSIS

2004_I_24,an industrial dispute was raised by the appellants herein as their services were not being regularized by the respondent.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,as regard the claim of equal pay for equal work the learned counsel would urge that the high court has failed to consider the same in its true perspective.,ARGUMENT
2004_I_24,furthermore from the reliefs claimed it would appear that the appellants had inter alia prayed for continuance of their services by the indore municipal corporation which knocks off the very basis of their claim.,ARGUMENT

2004_I_24,indisputably the conditions precedent for appointment of the officers and servants of the authority as contained in the service rules had not been complied with.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,the appointments of the appellants were therefore void ab initio being opposed to public policy as also violative of articles 14 and 16 of the constitution of india.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,a state before offering public service to a person must comply with the constitutional requirements of articles 14 and 16 of the constitution.,ANALYSIS

2004_I_24,a daily wager in absence of a statutory provision in this behalf would not be entitled to regularization.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,the 1961 act was enacted to provide for rules defining with sufficient precision in certain matters the conditions of employment of employees in undertakings in the state of madhya pradesh.,STATUTE
2004_I_24,by reason of the provisions of the said act application of standard standing orders to undertakings has been provided in terms whereof the matters to be provided in the standard standing orders have been specified.,STATUTE

2004_I_24,with a view to become eligible to be considered as a permanent employee or a temporary employee one must be appointed in terms thereof.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,permanent employee has been divided in two categories i who had been appointed against a clear vacancy in one or more posts as probationers and otherwise and ii whose name had been registered at muster roll and who has been given a ticket of permanent employee.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,a ticket of permanent employee was thus required to be issued in terms of order 3 of the standard standing orders.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,the matter relating to recruitment is governed by the 1973 act and the 1987 rules.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,in absence of any specific directions contained in the schedule appended to the standing orders the statute and the statutory rules applicable to the employees of the respondent shall prevail.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,the scheme of the employees provident fund or the leave rules would not alter the nature and character of their appointments.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,the nature of their employment continues save and except a case where a statute interdicts which in turn would be subject to the constitutional limitations.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,for the purpose of obtaining a permanent status constitutional and statutory conditions precedent therefor must be fulfilled.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,the appointments thus had been made for the purpose of the project which as indicated hereinbefore came to an end.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,the appellants having been employed on daily wages did not hold any post.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,they were not appointed in terms of the provisions of the statute.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,they were not therefore entitled to take the recourse of the doctrine of equal pay for equal work as adumbrated in articles 14 and 39d of the constitution of india.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,the burden was on the appellants to establish that they had a right to invoke the said doctrine in terms of article 14 of the constitution of india.,ANALYSIS
2004_I_24,for the purpose of invoking the said doctrine the nature of the work and responsibility attached to the post are some of the factors which were bound to be taken into consideration.,ANALYSIS

2004_C_129,the judgment forms subject matter of challenge in these appeals.,FACTS
2004_C_129,the doctrines of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation were applicable to the facts of the case.,ARGUMENT
2004_C_129,there was no material to show existence of any overriding public interest to rule out application of the aforesaid doctrine there was no scope for retrospective withdrawal.,ARGUMENT
2004_C_129,in any event before withdrawal of the benefits no opportunity of hearing was granted.,ARGUMENT
2004_C_129,the stand taken by the present appellants before the tribunal and the high court was rejected.,FACTS
2004_C_129,with reference to the files produced certain factual conclusions were arrived at the correctness of those form the core challenge in these appeals.,FACTS
2004_C_129,a new class of estoppel has come to be recognized by the courts in this country as well as in england.,FACTS
2004_C_129,the doctrine of promissory estoppel has assumed importance in recent years though it was dimly noticed in some of the earlier cases.,FACTS
2004_C_129,but that principle does not create any cause of action which did not exist before so that where a promise is made which is not supported by any consideration the promise can not bring an action on the basis of that promise.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,promissory estoppel is defined in black 's law distionary as an estoppel which arises when there is a promise which promissor should reasonable expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of promisee and which does include such action or forbearance and such promise is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of promise.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,if any concession has been given it can be withdrawn at any time and no time limit should be insisted upon before it was withdrawn.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,the rule of promissory estoppel can be invoked only if on the basis of representation made by the government the industry was established to avail benefit if of exemption.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,a person may have a legitimate expectation of being treated in a certain way by an administrative authority even though he has no legal right in private law to receive such treatment.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,the expectation may arise either from a representation or promise made by the authority including an implied representation or from consistent past practice.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,the doctrine of legitimate expectation has an important place in the developing law of judicial review.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,it is however not necessary to explore the doctrine in this case it is enough merely to note that a legitimate expectation can provide a sufficient interest to enable one who can not point to the existence of a substantive right to obtain the leave of the court to apply for judicial review.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,it is generally agreed that legitimate expectation gives the applicant sufficient locus standi for judicial review and that the doctrine of legitimate expectation to be confined mostly to right to a fair hearing before a decision which results in negativing a promise or withdrawing an undertaking is taken.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,the doctrine does not give scope to claim relief straightway from the administrative authorities as no crystallized right as such involved.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,the protection of such legitimate expectation does not require the fulfilment of the expectation where an overriding public interest requires otherwise.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,the basic requirement of article 14 is fairness in action by the state and non arbitrariness in essence and substance is the heart beat of fair play.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,actions are amenable in the panorama of judicial review only to the extent that the state must act validity for discernible reasons not whimsically for any ulterior purpose.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,the meaning and true import and concept of arbitrariness is more easily visualized than precisely defined.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,a question whether the impugned action is arbitrary or not is to be ultimately answered on the facts and circumstances of a given case.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,a basic and obvious test to apply in such cases is to see whether there is any discernible principle emerging from the impugned action and if so does if really satisfy the test of reasonableness.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,every state action must be informed by reason and it follows that an act uninformed by reason is per se arbitrary.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,something overwhelming must appear before the court will intervene.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,that is and ought to be a difficult onus for an applicant to discharge.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,the reasonableness in administrative law must therefore distinguish between proper course and improper abuse of power.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,nor is the test court 's own standard of reasonableness as it might conceive it in a given situation.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,the point to note is that the thing is not unreasonable in the legal sense merely because the court thinks it to be unwise.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,the decision maker has the choice in the balancing of the pros and cons relevant to the change in policy.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,it is therefore clear that the choice of police is for the decision maker and not the court.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,a claim based on merely legitimate expectation without anything more can not ipso facto give a right.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,how significant is the statement that today is tomorrows yesterday.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,the present is as we experience it the past is a present memory and future is a present expectation.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,if a denial of legitimate expectation in a given case amounts to denial of right guaranteed or is arbitrary discriminatory unfair or biased gross abuse of power of violation of principles of natural justice the same can be questioned on the well known grounds attracting article 14 but a claim based on mere legitimate expectation without anything more can not ipso facto give a right to invoke these principles.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,it can be one of the grounds to consider but the court must lift the veil and see whether the decision is violative of these principles warranting interference.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,if the state acts within the bounds of reasonableness it would be legitimate to take into consideration the national priorities and adopt trade policies.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,as noted above the ultimate test is whether on the touchstone of reasonableness the policy decision comes out unscathed.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,reasonableness of restriction is to be determined in an objective manner and from the standpoint of interest of the general public and not from the standpoint of the interests of persons upon whom the restrictions have been imposed or upon abstract consideration.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,a restriction can not be said to be unreasonable merely because in a given case it operates harshly.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,in determining whether there is any unfairness involved the nature of the right alleged to have taken infringed the underlying purpose of the restriction imposed the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby the disproportion of the imposition the prevailing condition at the relevant time enter into judicial verdict the reasonableness of the legitimate expectation has to be determined with respect to the circumstances relating to the trade or business in question.,ANALYSIS
2004_C_129,the governor shall make rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of the government of the state and for the allocating among ministers of the said business in so far as it is not business with respect to which the governor is by or under this constitution required to act in his discretion.,STATUTE
2004_C_129,the plea of the appellants regarding legitimate expectation shall be considered by the high court in the light of materials to be placed by the respondents by affidavits as directed above.,ANALYSIS

2008_I_54,in bhagat ram v state of punjab air 1954 sc 621 1954 indlaw sc 188it was laid down that where the case depends upon the conclusion drawn from circumstances the cumulative effect of the circumstances must be such as to negative the innocence of the accused and bring the offences home beyond any reasonable doubt.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,1992 indlaw sc 107it was pointed out that great care must be taken in evaluating circumstantial evidence and if the evidence relied on is reasonably capable of two inferences the one in favour of the accused must be accepted.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,it was also pointed out that the circumstances relied upon must be found to have been fully established and the cumulative effect of all the facts so established must be consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,law is well settled that the prosecution while relying upon the confessional statement leading to discovery of articles under section 27 of the evidence act has to prove through cogent evidence that the statement has been made voluntarily and leads to discovery of the relevant facts.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,the scope and ambit of section 27 of the evidence act had been stated and restated in several decisions of this court.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,while testing the reliability of such evidence the court has to see whether it was voluntarily stated by the accused.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,the alleged statement made by the accused led to discovery of knife bloodstained clothes rope etc.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,unfortunately for the prosecution there is no evidence to show that in fact the wearing apparels containing bloodstains belonged to the accused save and except the alleged confessional statement.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,no witness has spoken that those clothes were worn by the accused at any time far less at or about the time of occurrence.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,it is also to be kept in view that those articles were recovered from the house of p w 3 and at the initial stage of investigation p w 3 himself was one of the suspected person and he was arrested.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,therefore the statement of p w 3 and his mother that those articles were brought by the accused and left in the upstairs room is to be considered with a pinch of salt.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,moreover there is nothing to indicate that in fact the bloodstained clothes and rope had tallied with the blood grouping of the deceased.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,the knife did not contain any bloodstain.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,therefore the aspect relating to recovery of articles from the house of p w 3 and his mother can not be considered as a link to complete the chain of circumstantial evidence.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,since the golden jewellery had been molten and were recovered in the shape of ingots it would be very hazardous to come to the conclusion that in fact the golden jewellery belonged to the deceased.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,if the accused had killed the deceased and stolen those golden jewellery there is no reason as to why he had also not taken ear rings from the deceased.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,the fact that ear rings were on the dead body is admitted by the prosecution.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,the fact that there had been a statement allegedly made by p w 1 leading to recovery of a parallel key from the dash board of the car of p w 1cannot be lost sight of.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,law is well settled that when the prosecution relies upon circumstantial evidence all the links in the chain of circumstances must be complete and should be proved through cogent evidence.,ANALYSIS
2008_I_54,when the judgment of the high court is analysed in the background of what has been stated by this court as regards circumstantial evidence the inevitable conclusion is that the impugned judgment of the high court does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant interference.,ANALYSIS

1987_M_123,no document was filed to show that abdul khader was declared by the revenue courts as a protected tenant.,ANALYSIS
1987_M_123,there being no such finding by the revenue officer on the other hand there being a finding mat abdul khader was not a protected tenant by the revenue authorities it was not open to the arbitrator to decide the question of protected tenancy.,ANALYSIS
1987_M_123,by the scheme of the central act compensation was payable to persons who had interest in the land acquired.,ANALYSIS
1987_M_123,who are the persons who have interest in the land had to be decided in accordance with the law and the evidence.,ANALYSIS
1987_M_123,determination by the revenue authorities and non determination is not conclusive or decisive.,ANALYSIS
1987_M_123,it is clear that s 102 of the andhra pradesh act mentions that after acquisition the act was not to apply in respect of certain land.,ANALYSIS
1987_M_123,therefore it was submitted by the respondents that s 99 of the andhra pradesh act which made the determination by the tahsildar to be final and debarred other courts from going into the question did not apply in case of compensation payable.,ANALYSIS
1987_M_123,in the background of the totality of circumstances as manifest in the different orders it appeared to the arbitrator and the court that the entry which was made in favour of abdul khader as the protected tenant was of doubtful validity.,ANALYSIS
1987_M_123,in determining the amount of compensation payable to abdul khader under the central act his interests in the property had to be determined.,ANALYSIS
1987_M_123,in another context the high court of andhra pradesh enunciated the position that it was necessary to determine the interest of the persons claiming compensation.,ANALYSIS
1987_M_123,he has a right to object to the acquisition andor the quantum of compensation.,ANALYSIS

1987_M_123,appeal dismissed.,JUDGMENT
1954_M_25,this appeal with special leave is directed against the judgment and order of the labour appellate tribunal of india in a dispute regarding the workers claim for bonus.,FACTS
1954_M_25,dividend on ordinary shares being the maximum that could be paid under the public companies limitation of dividend ordinance of 1948 and also paid to the workers their full share of bonus at annas 4 in a rupee of their basic earnings.,FACTS
1954_M_25,below those obtained in 1948. the basic wages were increased from the 1st december 1948 by order of the government of uttar pradesh and the total wages paid were therefore higher than those in the previous year.,FACTS
1954_M_25,there was moreover indiscipline amongst the workers and production suffered.,FACTS
1954_M_25,further the management were unable to secure cotton which resulted in the curtailment of the working hours.,FACTS
1954_M_25,the industrial dispute which thus arose was referred for enquiry and recording of an award to the regional conciliation board textile kanpur.,FACTS
1954_M_25,the conciliation board by a majority decision repelled the contention of the appellant and awarded the payment of bonus at annas 4 per rupee.,FACTS
1954_M_25,on an appeal taken by the appellant to the industrial court textiles and hosiery kanpur the industrial court accepted the contention of the appellant allowed the appeal and set aside the award.,FACTS
1954_M_25,the appellant filed this appeal against that decision after obtaining special leave from this court.,FACTS
1954_M_25,it is classified amongst the methods of wage payment.,ANALYSIS
1954_M_25,there are however two conditions which have to be satisfied before a demand for bonus can be justified and they are 1 when wages fall short of the living standard and 2 the industry makes huge profits part of which are due to the contribution which the workmen make in increasing production.,ANALYSIS
1954_M_25,the demand for bonus becomes an industrial claim when either or both these conditions are satisfied.,ANALYSIS
1954_M_25,the surplus that remained after meeting the aforesaid deductions would be available for distribution as bonus.,ANALYSIS
1954_M_25,if in any particular year the working of the industrial concern has resulted in loss there is no basis nor justification for a demand for bonus.,ANALYSIS
1954_M_25,on the accounts of each year being made up and the profits of the industrial concern being ascertained the workers during the particular year have their demand for bonus fully satisfied out of the surplus profits and the balance of profits is allocated and carried over in the accounts.,ANALYSIS
1954_M_25,no further claimed payment of bonus out of those reserves or undistributed profits can therefore survive.,ANALYSIS
1954_M_25,without embarking upon a discussion as to the exact connotation of the expression social justice we may only observe that the concept of social justice does not emanate from the fanciful notions of any particular adjudicator but must be founded on a more solid foundation.,ARGUMENT
1954_M_25,that full bench decision stands and this tribunal and all other tribunals are bound by it.,ANALYSIS
1954_M_25,it is also significant to note that even while importing considerations of social justice the labour appellate tribunal was oblivious of the fact that it was by their own acts of indiscipline and strike that the workers of the appellant company themselves contributed to the trading losses incurred by the appellant and it hardly lay in their mouth then to contend that they were none the less entitled to a payment of bonus commensurate with the dividend paid to the shareholders out of the undistributed profits of the previous years.,ANALYSIS
1954_M_25,ordinance of 1948 the whole of the profits of 1948 could have been distributed after paying the workers bonus in that year of four annas in the rupee.,ANALYSIS
1954_M_25,the appeal will accordingly be allowed with costs.,JUDGMENT

2006_A_36,invoices with a higher value were presented before the indian customs authorities with a view to avail depb incentives but in fact invoices with a lower value were presented for clearance.,FACTS
2006_A_36,non placement of vital material documents before the detaining authority non supply of documents relied on or referred to in the order of detention as also non application of mind on the part of the detaining authority had been raised.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_36,the final order of detention was preceded not only on the basis of raids conducted in various premises recording of statements of a large number of witnesses carrying on intensive inquiries both within india and outside india obtaining test reports from three different laboratories but also the fact that despite notices appellant and his associates did not cooperate with the investigating authorities.,ARGUMENT
2006_A_36,they initiated various civil proceedings from time to time obtained various interim orders and thus delay in passing the order of detention can not be said to have not been explained.,ARGUMENT
2006_A_36,it was therefore difficult to appreciate why order of detention could not be passed on the basis of the materials gathered by them.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_36,it is no doubt true that if the delay is sufficiently explained the same would not be a ground for quashing an order of detention under cofeposa but as in this case a major part of delay remains unexplained.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_36,it would be reasonable to assume that if the district magistrate of burdwan was really and genuinely satisfied after proper application of mind to the materials before him that it was necessary to detain the petitioner with a view to preventing him from acting in a prejudicial manner he would have acted with greater promptitude both in making the order of detention as also in securing the arrest of the petitioner and the petitioner would not have been allowed to remain at large for such a long period of time to carry on his nefarious activities.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_36,the same was not done.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_36,the original of such documents might not been available with the detaining authority but admittedly the xeroxed copies were.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_36,it has not been denied or disputed that even the xeroxed copies of the said documents had not been supplied to the detenue.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_36,what is necessary to be supplied is the relevant and the material documents but thus all relevant documents must be supplied so as to enable the detenue to make an effective representation which is his fundamental right u art 225 of the constitution of india.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_36,the detaining authority moreover while relying on the said documents in one part of the order of detention could not have stated in another part that he was not relying thereupon.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_36,the very fact that he had referred to the said statements in ex tenso is itself a pointer to the fact that he had relied upon the said documents.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_36,even in the earlier part of the impugned order of detention i e detaining authority appears to have drawn his own conclusions.,ANALYSIS
2006_A_36,the judgment of the high court therefore cannot be sustained.,JUDGMENT
2006_A_36,it is set aside accordingly and the order of detention passed against appellant is quashed.,JUDGMENT
2006_A_36,the appeal is allowed.,JUDGMENT

2007_S_632,the state of manipur had not framed any recruitment rules for appointment inter alia in the revenue department and in particular the field staff thereof.,FACTS

2007_S_632,he was also to be the chairman of the departmental promotion committee for non ministerial post of the revenue department.,FACTS
2007_S_632,the commissioner allegedly made certain appointments in the posts of mandols process servers and zilladars which was not within the knowledge of the state.,FACTS
2007_S_632,the said appointments were made on temporary basis.,FACTS
2007_S_632,he has been making false and wrong allegations against the commissioner revenue and putting him false position.,FACTS
2007_S_632,their appointments were also cancelled on similar grounds.,FACTS
2007_S_632,the posts of field staffs of the revenue department of the state of manipur were thus required to be filled up having regard to the said constitutional scheme.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,the offers of appointment were cancelled not on the ground that some irregularities had been committed in the process of recruitment but on the ground that they had been non est in the eye of law.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,the purported appointment letters were fake ones.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,they were not issued by any authority competent therefor.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,if the offers of appointments issued in favour of the respondents herein were forged documents the state could not have been compelled to pay salaries to them from the state exchequer.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,any action which had not been taken by an authority competent therefor and in complete violation of the constitutional and legal framework would not be binding on the state.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,in any event having regard to the fact that the said authority himself had denied to have issued a letter there was no reason for the state not to act pursuant thereto or in furtherance thereof.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,the action of the state did not thus lack bonafide.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,with a view to establish their legal rights to enable the high court to issue a writ of mandamus the respondents were obligated to establish that the appointments had been made upon following the constitutional mandate adumbrated in arts 14 and 16 of the constitution of india.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,they have not been able to show that any advertisement had been issued inviting applications from eligible candidates to fill up the said posts.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,it has also not been shown that the vacancies had been notified to the employment exchange.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,the commissioner furthermore was not the appointing authority.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,he was only a cadre controlling authority.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,he was merely put a chairman of the dpc for non ministerial post of the revenue department.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,the appointing authority in absence of any delegation of power having been made in that behalf was the state government.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,he therefore was wholly incompetent to issue the appointment letters.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,it is for this reason that we base our decision on the ground that independent of any statutory right available to the appointees and assuming for the purpose of this case that the rights flow only from the contract of appointment the impugned circular issued in exercise of the executive power of the state must satisfy art 14 of the constitution and if it is shown to be arbitrary it must be struck down.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,however we have referred to certain provisions relating to initial appointment termination or renewal of tenure to indicate that the action is controlled at least by settled guidelines followed by the state of u p for a long time.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,this too is relevant for deciding the question of arbitrariness alleged in the present case.,ANALYSIS

2007_S_632,wade says that while futile writs may not be issued a distinction has to be made according to the nature of the decision.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,thus in relation to cases other than those relating to admitted or indisputable facts there is a considerable divergence of opinion whether the applicant can be compelled to prove that the outcome will be in his favour or he has to prove a case of substance or if he can prove a real likelihood of success or if he is entitled to relief even if there is some remote chance of success.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,if such appointment orders are a nullity the question of observance of principles of natural justice would not arise.,ANALYSIS
2007_S_632,their application may be subject to the provisions of a statute or statutory rule.,ANALYSIS

1978_M_13,admittedly on the coming into force of the bombay merged territories and areas jagirs abolition act1953 hereinafter referred to as the act i e with effect from respondent 's daljitgarh jagir stood abolished and all his rights in the jagir villages save as expressly provided by or under the act were extinguished and the respondent became entitled to compensation under s 11 of the act.,FACTS
1978_M_13,the appellants seek to challenge the said judgment and order of the gujarat high court in this appeal.,FACTS
1978_M_13,in the first place the preamble and s 3 of the act clearly show that the object of the enactment is to abolish jagirs of all kinds in the merged territories and merged areas in the state of bombay and to convert all jagir villages into unalienated villages liable to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the bombay land revenue code.,ANALYSIS
1978_M_13,secondly compensation is made payable under s 11 of the act to jagirdars whose jagirs and other incidental rights have been extinguished but it will be pertinent to note that no provision has been made for payment of compensation in respect of rights to mines and mineral products in a jagir village obviously because if by the grant in question the jagirdar has not been given any rights to mines and mineral products no compensation would be payable and if there be a grant of mines and mineral products the same have been saved to the jagirdar under s 10 of the act.,ANALYSIS
1978_M_13,thirdly the quantum of compensation payable for abolition of jagir and extinguishment of his other rights depends upon what kind of jagir has been abolished whether it is proprietary or non proprietary in other words it is clear that the inquiry into the nature of the jagir under s 2 4 i is for the purpose of determining the quantum of compensation payable to a jagirdar inasmuch as in the case of a non proprietary jagir the jagirdar is entitled to compensation at the rate of three times the amount of land revenue received by or due to him as an incident of jagir during the five years immediately before the appointed date under s 11 1while in the case of a proprietary jagir in respect of land held by a permanent holder the jagirdar is entitled to compensation equivalent to three multiples of the assessment fixed for such land s 113 provides for compensation and computation thereof to a jagirdar having any right or interest in any property referred to in s 8 in such an inquiry ordinarily no determination of any rights of the jagirdar to mines or mineral products in a jagir village will be undertaken for no compensation is payable in respect of any rights to mines and mineral products in a jagir village.,ANALYSIS
1978_M_13,there is yet one more aspect emerging from the definition of the expression proprietary jagir which leads to the same inference.,ANALYSIS
1978_M_13,proprietary jagir has been defined in s 2xviii to mean a jagir in respect of which the jagirdar under the terms of a grant or agreement or by custom or usage is entitled to any rights or interest in the soil.,ANALYSIS
1978_M_13,in other words the competent authority holding an inquiry under s 24 i can come to the conclusion that a particular jagir is proprietary if it finds that the jagirdar under the terms of a grant or agreement is entitled to some rights or interest in the soil other than mines or mineral products.,ANALYSIS
1978_M_13,in other words before the collector can initiate an inquiry under that provision either the state or the individual must put forward a claim to a property or any right in or over the property and it is such claim that is to be inquired into by the collector whose decision subject to a civil suit filed within one year is rendered final.,ANALYSIS
1978_M_13,it is thus clear that by these two applications the respondent had not put forward any claim as such to excavating gravel and stones for the first time but had merely requested the making of appropriate entry with regard to his said right which had already been recognised by the state government previously.,ANALYSIS
1978_M_13,that being the position there was no occasion for the collector to initiate the inquiry under s 372 of the code in fact he had no jurisdiction to do so the condition precedent not being satisfied.,ANALYSIS
1978_M_13,besides while determining the proprietary nature of the grant under s 241 of the act the competent authority had on evidence led before it alluded among others to the respondent 's right to excavate and sell gravel and stones and enjoyment thereof by the respondent.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,he was informed that the deceased had died as a result of stab injuries received and therefore he was to take necessary steps.,FACTS
2009_S_146,on receipt of the aforesaid message pw 21 along with asi tabit mamlekar went to the scene of offence.,FACTS
2009_S_146,they reached the scene of offence at about 11 30 p m but found the entire place plunged into darkness and with the help of torch light pw 21 surveyed the scene of offence.,FACTS
2009_S_146,s p shri raikar and p i shri alan osa were sent in their search.,FACTS
2009_S_146,after reaching the police station a complaint which is marked as exhibit pw 1 a was lodged by pw 1 in which it was alleged that pw 1 pw 8 pw 18 the deceased rauji and his brother narayan were residing in one house in banastari and they used to share a common kitchen between them.,FACTS
2009_S_146,it was further alleged by pw 1 that two or three days before the ganesh festival deceased rauji had informed narayan that he would install statue of lord ganesh in the house and accordingly he had purchased the same.,FACTS
2009_S_146,on his return he went to take bath and after having bath he went and switched off the light of the room.,FACTS
2009_S_146,as soon as the deceased switched off the light the appellant came from the room and started abusing rauji.,FACTS
2009_S_146,there was a heated exchange of words between rauji and the appellant switched on the light which was again switched off by rauji the deceased.,FACTS
2009_S_146,there was already an oil lamp burning which was attached to the ceiling by a brass chain.,FACTS
2009_S_146,when they went there the appellant went to his mother 's room and brought a knife with which he stabbed rauji.,FACTS
2009_S_146,at that time all the accused persons were in the balcony.,FACTS
2009_S_146,it was also alleged that when pw 8 tried to intervene the other three accused started assaulting her with fists and slaps.,FACTS
2009_S_146,pw 8 pw 18 and pw 1 then lifted rauji and brought him in the courtyard.,FACTS
2009_S_146,the juvenile offender sarita went inside the house and brought out one iron pipe which she handed over to the appellant who then hit the said pipe on the right leg of pw 1 and also gave a blow with the said pipe on rauji 's right hand.,FACTS
2009_S_146,the accused then started assaulting her and pw 8 with slaps.,FACTS
2009_S_146,whereupon the police took him to the hospital in the police jeep along with pw 1 pw 2 and pw 8. on the basis of complaint made by pw 1 an fir was registered and the accused came to be arrested.,FACTS
2009_S_146,the trial court framed charges against all the accused persons for the offence under sections 302 323 143 147 and 149 of the ipc.,FACTS
2009_S_146,the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.,FACTS
2009_S_146,he also submitted that the high court has not given any reason for setting aside the appeal against acquittal which was passed after appreciating the entire evidence on record.,ARGUMENT
2009_S_146,he has drawn our attention towards the entire evidence on record including the cross examination part and with the help of the same he submitted that the entire alleged incident in question had taken place when there was complete darkness at the scene of occurrence.,ARGUMENT
2009_S_146,a scuffle started between the nephew and the uncle in which the accused persons also received injuries and therefore the right of private defence of the appellant was available and in that view of the matter the order of conviction and sentence is liable to be set aside.,ARGUMENT
2009_S_146,the starting point of the incident in question as indicated from the evidence on record is the hall where apparently a dispute started between the parties with regard to the electricity connection in the house.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,the deceased tried to put off the light of one particular room at which the appellant and other accused persons became annoyed and the appellant switched on the light which was again switched off by the deceased.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,at this the deceased became annoyed and the appellant removed the fuse of the electricity which act of his plunged the entire house into darkness.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,but in any case there was an electricity light post in the front of the house which was giving enough light to the house.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,there is also evidence on record to show that even outsiders were watching the incident from the road which indicates that there was sufficient light for them to see what was happening in the house where the incident had taken place.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,he in his deposition specifically stated that he found that the back door as well as the front door of the house were latched from inside and in front of the house there was a road where there was an electricity pole and there was a street tube light by which the house could be visible and even the lights of the vehicles were flashed at the house.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,he stated that although the house had electricity connection but was not having the electricity supply.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,he gave instructions to his subordinate and also to the people around that nobody should touch any article lying at the scene of occurrence.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,he stated that he made preliminary enquiry and brought yashoda and her two daughters to the police station and sent two other officers in search of accused nos 1 and 2 who were not found in the house.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,he also stated that he got the complaint registered at the police station which was lodged by pw 1 and that on the next day he again went to the scene of offence and seized the properties involved in the crime which were sealed.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,and he was medically examined.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,on medical examination his injury was found to be simple.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,even assuming that pw 21 the investigating officer could have entered the aforesaid information received from psi of panaji police station in the general diary yet they said entry could not have been held or treated to be an fir.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,the information received by him was very cryptic and without any detail about the incident in question and therefore in any case there was no possibility of recording an fir at that stage.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,the place of occurrence was in total darkness and even the persons belonging to the complainant side were not available therefore bringing them to the police station where there was sufficient light and recording the complaint at 3 00 a m can not in any manner cast any doubt on the veracity of the prosecution case.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,in that view of the matter it can not be said that the fir was in any manner hit by the provisions of section 162 of crpc.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,besides all the aforesaid eye witnesses were inmates of the house and they would know as to who had given the blows for they specifically stated that initially the appellant did not have the knife in his hand but when the deceased and others went to the balcony then he went inside the house and brought a knife with which he gave stab injuries to the deceased which became fatal and as a result of which the deceased died while he was being taken to the hospital.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,the aforesaid eye witnesses although are related witnesses were natural witnesses for they were the inmates of the house where the incident had taken place.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,the said eye witnesses are consistent about the principal act of the appellant in stabbing the deceased.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,the discrepancies which were sought to be pointed out are minor discrepancies without in any manner affecting the substratum of the prosecution case and therefore minor discrepancies in the evidence of the eye witnesses are immaterial.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,and we find that none of the aforesaid submissions has any basis.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,there is cogent and reliable evidence on record to prove and establish that the accused has committed the act of stabbing as a result of which the deceased had died.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,before dwelling further into the factual matrix of the case on the basis of which the high court convicted the appellant section 302 ipc it would be useful to briefly recapitulate the law on the point.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,section 299 and section 300 ipc deals with the definition of culpable homicide and murder respectively.,STATUTE
2009_S_146,section 300 ipc however deals with murder although there is no clear definition of murder provided in section 300 ipc.,STATUTE
2009_S_146,it has been repeatedly held by this court that culpable homicide is the genus and murder is species and that all murders are culpable homicide but not vice versa.,STATUTE
2009_S_146,only the intention of causing the bodily injury coupled with the offender 's knowledge of the likelihood of such injury causing the death of the particular victim is sufficient to bring the killing within the ambit of this clause.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,as already noted it is quite clear from the record that there was an altercation preceding the incident.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,the place of occurrence is a residence inhabited by both the parties and there is no evidence on record that the deceased was armed with any weapon.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,factually therefore there was only one main injury caused due to stabbing and that also was given on the back side of the deceased and therefore it can not be said that there was any intention to kill or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,records clearly establish that there was indeed a scuffle between the parties with regard to the availability of electricity in a particular room and during the course of scuffle the appellant also received an injury which was simple in nature and that there was heated exchange of words and scuffle between the parties before the actual incident of stabbing took place.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,there is therefore provocation and the incident happened at the spur of the moment.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,it is trite law that section 304 part ii comes into play when the death is caused by doing an act with knowledge that it is likely to cause death but there is no intention on the part of the accused either to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.,ANALYSIS
2009_S_146,his bail bonds shall stand cancelled and the appellant shall surrender immediately to serve out the remaining period of sentence.,JUDGMENT

1977_P_19,while calculating the aforesaid amount of maternity benefit the establishment admittedly excluded twelve sundays being wageless holidays which fell during the period of the respondent 's actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and the six weeks immediately following that day.,FACTS
1977_P_19,dissatisfied with this computation the respondent made a representation to her employers claiming maternity benefit for the entire period of twelve weeks under the act i e for 84 days on the plea that a week consisted of seven days.,FACTS
1977_P_19,the claim preferred by the respondent was resisted by the appellant herein who contended that the respondent was admittedly working and was being paid only for six days in a week and that a pregnant woman worker is entitled to maternity benefit for 72 days which are the normal working days in twelve weeks and not for 84 days as no wage is payable for the seventh day of the week i e sunday which is a nonworking wageless holiday.,FACTS
1977_P_19,contending that the claim made by the respondent was untenable as normally a worker works only for six days in a week and the maternity benefit had to be computed only for 72 days.,FACTS
1977_P_19,as against this the respondent pleaded that the computation had to be made not with reference to the actual number of working days but with reference to total number of days covered by twelve weeks i e 84 days.,FACTS
1977_P_19,i any bonus other than incentive bonus ii over time earnings and any deduction or payment on account of fines iii any contribution paid or payable by the employer to any pension fund or provident fund or for the benefit of the woman under any law for the time being in force and iv any gratuity payable on the termination of service.,STATUTE
1977_P_19,benefit 1subject to the provisions of this act every woman shall be entitled to and her employer shall be liable for the payment of maternity benefit at the rate of the average daily wage for the period of her actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and for the six weeks immediately following that day.,STATUTE
1977_P_19,the provisions of s 5 of the act quoted above make it clear that a woman worker who expects a child is entitled to maternity benefit for a maximum period of twelve weeks which is split up into two periods viz prenatal and post natal.,ANALYSIS
1977_P_19,the first one i e prenatal or ante natal period is limited to the period of woman 's actual absence extending upto six weeks immediately preceding and including the day on which her delivery occurs and the second one which is postnatal compulsory period consists of six weeks immediately following the day of delivery.,ANALYSIS
1977_P_19,the benefit has to be calculated for the aforesaid two periods on the basis of the average daily wage.,ANALYSIS
1977_P_19,according to the explanation appended to s 51 of the act the average daily wage has to be computed taking into consideration the average of the woman 's wager payable to her for the days on which she has worked during the period of three calendar months immediately preceding the date from which she absents herself on account of maternity or one rupee a day whichever is higher.,ANALYSIS
1977_P_19,for fixing the average daily wage it has therefore first to be ascertained whether the wages with were paid or were payable to the woman was for time work or for piece work.,ANALYSIS
1977_P_19,it has next to be ascertained as to what were the cash wages paid or payable to her in terms of the definition contained in s 3 n of the act for the days on which she worked during the period of three calendar months immediately preceding the date of delivery reckoned according to the british calendar month.,ANALYSIS
1977_P_19,the total wages thus worked out are to be divided by the number of days in the aforesaid three calendar months in order to arrive at the average daily wage.,ANALYSIS
1977_P_19,after thus finding out the average daily wage the liability of the employer in respect of the maternity benefit has to be calculated in terms of s 5 of the act for both ore natal and post natal period indicated above.,ANALYSIS

2007_U_18,satnam singh conveyed this information to sarpanch jora singh pw1 who was attending a marriage at that time.,FACTS
2007_U_18,jora singh accompanied by gurdeep singh pw3 thereupon rushed to ujjagar singh 's house and found mukhtiar kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room.,FACTS
2007_U_18,it appears that mukhtiar kaur 's relations with her in laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with ujjagar singh her uncle 7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that mukhtiar kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide.,FACTS
2007_U_18,after completion of the investigation at the spot mukhtiar kaur 's dead body was sent for its post mortem examination.,FACTS
2007_U_18,there is however absolutely no evidence to suggest even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant that he had done so without mukhtiar kaur 's consent or against her will.,ANALYSIS
2007_U_18,a few facts stand out from the prosecution story.,ANALYSIS
2007_U_18,first the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed dbbl gun is proved on record.,ANALYSIS
2007_U_18,the evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife mother and son and two daughters who were studying outside the village were frequent visitors but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident.,ANALYSIS
2007_U_18,it is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered one from near mukhtiar kaur 's dead body and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the forensic science laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom.,ANALYSIS
2007_U_18,the motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy.,ANALYSIS
2007_U_18,there could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i e mother wife son living in the village and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel but were frequent visitors home yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour.,ANALYSIS
2007_U_18,pjj wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point e whereas the appellant was found lying at point d in the same room.,ANALYSIS
2007_U_18,the question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant.,ANALYSIS
2007_U_18,it would be seen that both the sessions court and the high court were appalled by the allegations and findings of incestuous rape and murder.,ANALYSIS
2007_U_18,in this background the death sentence is not called for.,ANALYSIS
2007_U_18,with this modification the appeal is dismissed.,JUDGMENT
2008_C_166,challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a division bench of the madhya pradesh high court dismissing the writ appeal filed by the appellant on the ground that it was not maintainable.,FACTS
2008_C_166,the appeal was filed u s 21 of the m p uchacha nyayalay khand nyaypeth ko appeal adhiniyam2005.,FACTS
2008_C_166,additionally it is submitted that the prayer in the writ petition was to quash the order passed by the assistant commissioner commercial tax.,ARGUMENT
2008_C_166,it is the nature of the relief sought for and the controversy involved which determines the article which is applicable.,ANALYSIS
2008_C_166,the high court did not consider the nature of the controversy and the prayer involved in the writ petition.,ANALYSIS
2008_C_166,provided that no such appeal shall lie against an interlocutory order or against an order passed in exercise of supervisory jurisdiction u art 227 of the constitution of india.,STATUTE
2008_C_166,in a proceeding under that article the person authority or state against whom the direction order or writ is sought is a necessary party.,ANALYSIS
2008_C_166,under article 227however what comes up before the high court is the order or judgment of a subordinate court or tribunal for the purpose of ascertaining whether in giving such judgment or order that subordinate court or tribunal has acted within its authority and according to law.,ANALYSIS
2008_C_166,by art 226 the power of issuing prerogative writs possessed by the chartered high courts prior to the commencement of the constitution has been made wider and more extensive and conferred upon every high court.,ANALYSIS
2008_C_166,the nature of the exercise of the power under article 226however remains the same as in the case of the power of issuing prerogative writs possessed by the chartered high courts.,ANALYSIS
2008_C_166,it was open to the respondent to invoke the jurisdiction of the high court both u arts 226 and 227 of the constitution of india.,ANALYSIS
2008_C_166,once such a jurisdiction was invoked and when his writ petition was dismissed on merits it can not be said that the learned single judge had exercised his jurisdiction only u art 226 of the constitution of india.,ANALYSIS
2008_C_166,this conclusion directly flows from the relevant averments made in the writ petition and the nature of jurisdiction invoked by the respondent as noted by the learned single judge in his judgment as seen earlier.,ANALYSIS
2008_C_166,consequently it could not be said that cl 15 of the letters patent was not attracted for preferring appeal against the judgment of the learned single judge.,ANALYSIS
2008_C_166,it is also necessary to note that the appellant being the respondent in letters patent appeal joined issues on merits and did not take up the contention that the letters patent appeal was not maintainable.,ANALYSIS
2008_C_166,for all these reasons therefore the primary objection to the maintainability of the letters patent appeal as canvassed by learned counsel for the appellant has to be repelled.,ANALYSIS
2008_C_166,it can not be said in a hypertechnical manner that an order passed in a writ petition if there is assail to the order emerging from the inferior tribunal or subordinate court has to be treated all the time for all purposes to be u art 227 of the constitution of india.,ANALYSIS
2008_C_166,in addition a bare reading of this court 's earlier order shows that the impugned order is clearly erroneous.,ANALYSIS
2008_C_166,the impugned order is set aside.,JUDGMENT
2008_C_166,the writ appeal shall be heard by the division bench on merits.,JUDGMENT
2008_C_166,the appeal is allowed.,JUDGMENT

2001_S_1131,to constitute evidence of last seen together the evidence must definitely permit an inference being drawn that the victim and the accused were seen together at a point of time in close proximity with the time and date of the commission of crime.,ANALYSIS
2001_S_1131,any person even if innocent and not connected in any way with a gruesome crime which had recently occurred and was talk of the town if called by police and interrogated as a suspect would be scared and be apprehensive of the likelihood of his being implicated in the crime.,ANALYSIS
2001_S_1131,another circumstantial evidence relied on was that a stain of semen was found on the under pant of the accused.,ARGUMENT
2001_S_1131,as regards the dried stain of semen on the appellant 's under pant the court observed that the accused was a grown up man of 30 years and no compelling inference could arise that the stain was caused during the course of the sexual assault committed by him on the victim girl.,ARGUMENT
2001_S_1131,in the present case the age of the accused was about 21 years at the time of the incident.,ARGUMENT
2001_S_1131,on his arrest he was subjected to medical examination and found to be a potent and capable person.,ARGUMENT
2001_S_1131,presence of semen stain on underwear assuming that the underwear belonged to the accused though there is no evidence adduced in this regard is not by itself an incriminating piece of evidence connecting the accused with the crime in question.,ARGUMENT
2001_S_1131,p c and nowhere suggested during cross examination of prosecution witnesses that at the time of the incident he was at a place wherefrom he could not have reached the place of the offence on the date and at the time of its commission.,ANALYSIS
2001_S_1131,the plea of alibi postulates the physical impossibility of the presence of the accused at the scene of offence by reason of his presence at another place.,ANALYSIS
2001_S_1131,though the offence is gruesome and revolts the human conscience but an accused can be convicted only on legal evidence and if only a chain of circumstantial evidence has been so forged as to rule out the possibility of any other reasonable hypothesis excepting the guilt of the accused.,ANALYSIS
2001_S_1131,in shankarlal gyarasilal dixit 's case 1980 indlaw sc 47 supra this court cautioned human nature is too willing when faced with brutal crimes to spin stories out of strong suspicions.,ANALYSIS

2001_S_1131,the evidence of investigating officer given in the court should have a rhythm explaining step by step how the investigation proceeded leading to detection of the offender and collection of evidence against him.,ANALYSIS
2001_S_1131,this is necessary to exclude the likelihood of any innocent having been picked up and branded as culprit and then the gravity of the offence arousing human sympathy persuading the mind to be carried away by doubtful or dubious circumstances treating them as of beyond doubt evidentiary value.,ANALYSIS

2008_S_549,from a plain reading of section 121a of the act under which revisional jurisdiction can be exercised it would be clear that the high court while exercising such power is entitled to re appreciate the evidence when it finds that the conclusion arrived at by the appellate authority runs contrary to the materials on record and when it finds that there is no evidence to support the conclusion of the appellate authority or when it finds that the reasons given by the appellate authority are absolutely perverse and can not be supported by the evidence on record.,ANALYSIS

2007_C_121,u s 28 of the trade marks act1999registration gives to the registered proprietor of the trade mark the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided by the trade marks act.,ANALYSIS
2007_C_121,this deeming fiction can not be extended to the excise law.,ANALYSIS
2007_C_121,it is confined to the provisions of the trade marks act.,ANALYSIS
2007_C_121,it does however facilitate a remedy which may be enforced and obtained throughout the state and it established the record of facts affecting the right to the mark.,JUDGMENT
2007_C_121,registration itself does not create a trade mark.,JUDGMENT

2007_C_121,but that is not the case.,ANALYSIS
2007_C_121,the respondent company is described as the sole distributors on the label.,ANALYSIS
2007_C_121,the reasonable inference that could be drawn from this description surely is that the goods were the property of kipre and co and so also the mark.,ANALYSIS
2007_C_121,obviously therefore on the label as it stood it could not be said that the respondent company was the proprietor of the mark monarch nor could it be said that the mark was used by the respondent company as proprietor thereof.,ANALYSIS
2007_C_121,applying the principle of deemed equivalence we may clarify that if the ssi unit wrongly affixes a trade mark of another person be it registered or not or if it uses the trade mark of an ineligible person then such default would not be eliminated by the above principle of deemed equivalence embodied in s 28 of the trade marks act1999 as that principle is based on a deeming fiction which fiction is confined only to the provisions of the trade marks act.,STATUTE

2009_B_16,the form of copyright as regards dramatic work as has been held by the high court stating the same to be a part of the literary work is not correct as they connote two different things.,ARGUMENT
2009_B_16,the form of injunction granted in favour of the plaintiff respondent is not in terms of the provisions of the copyright act1957 as the appellant as an institution or otherwise is entitled to use the same in terms of clauses ai and l of sub section 1 of section 52 thereof.,ARGUMENT
2009_B_16,the copyright act1957 for shortthe act was enacted to amend and consolidate the law relating to copyright.,STATUTE
2009_B_16,the residuary clause will apply because it is well settled that no part of the stay lies in limbo.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,it was also not a case where respondent in any manner whatsoever waived her right.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,decree for injunction is an equitable relief.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,the courts while passing a decree for permanent injunction would avoid multiplicity of proceedings.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,the court while passing such a decree is obligated to consider the statutory provisions governing the same.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,for the said purpose it must be noticed as to what is a copyright and in respect of the matters the same can not be claimed or otherwise the same is lodged by conditions and subject to statutory limitation.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,2 where the same idea is being developed in a different manner it is manifest that the source being common similarities are bound to occur.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,in such a case the courts should determine whether or not the similarities are on fundamental or substantial aspects of the mode of expression adopted in the copyrighted work.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,if the defendant 's work is nothing but a literal imitation of the copyrighted work with some variations here and there it would amount to violation of the copyright.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,in other words in order to be actionable the copy must be a substantial and material one which at once leads to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of an act of piracy.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,3 one of the surest and the safest test to determine whether or not there has been a violation of copyright is to see if the reader spectator or the viewer after having read or seen both the works is clearly of the opinion and gets an unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the original.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,4 where the theme is the same but is presented and treated differently so that the subsequent work becomes a completely new work no question of violation of copyright arises.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,no infringement of the copyright comes into existence.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,a violation of copyright amounts to an act of piracy it must be proved by clear and cogent evidence after applying the various tests laid down by the case law discussed above.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,however the question is of the violation of the copyright of stage play by a film producer or a director the task of the plaintiff becomes more difficult to prove piracy.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,it is manifest that unlike a stage play a film has a much broader prospective wider field and a bigger background where the defendants can by introducing a variety of incidents give a colour and complexion different from the manner in which the copyrighted work has expressed the idea.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,section 52 of the act provides for certain acts which would not constitute an infringement of copyright.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,when a fair dealing is made inter alia of a literary or dramatic work for the purpose of private use including research and criticism or review whether of that work or of any other work the right in terms of the provisions of the said act can not be claimed.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,thus if some performance or dance is carried out within the purview of the said clause the order of injunction shall not be applicable.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,similarly appellant being an educational institution if the dance is performed within the meaning of provisions of clause i of sub section 1 of section 52 of the act strictly the order of injunction shall not apply thereto also.,ANALYSIS
2009_B_16,yet again if such performance is conducted before a non paying audience by the appellant which is an institution if it comes within the purview of amateur club or society the same would not constitute any violation of the said order of injunction.,ANALYSIS

1963_S_59,it obtained licences from the government under the electricity act for supply of electrical energy to visakhapatnam anakapalli and some other places.,FACTS
1963_S_59,rajahmurthy were started apparently by raju himself and the aeco was appointed the managing agent of each of these concerns.,FACTS
1963_S_59,the original managing agency agreement in favour of aeco with respect to vesco was for a period of 15 years i e from 1933 to 1948 and was later renewed for the remaining term of the currency of the licence granted by the government under the electricity act.,FACTS
1963_S_59,a mention may be made of the fact that in june 1952 the vesco undertaking was acquired by the government under the provisions of the electricity undertaking acquisition act but nothing turns on it.,FACTS
1963_S_59,the vesco had its own board of directors while the aeco had also its own separate board of directors.,FACTS
1963_S_59,the vesco had no managing director but at each meeting of its board of directors one of the directors used to be elected chairman.,FACTS
1963_S_59,the same practice was followed at the meeting of the general body of the shareholders.,FACTS
1963_S_59,he died in the year 1939 and was succeeded by r k n g raju an advocate of rajahmundry.,FACTS
1963_S_59,this person however did not shift to visakhapatnam on his becoming the managing director but continued to stay most of the time at rajahmundry.,FACTS
1963_S_59,in 1944 this person resigned from his appointments and started his own business in radio and electrical goods in the name of d brothers.,FACTS
1963_S_59,by cheques.,FACTS
1963_S_59,this amount was posted in vesco 's cash handover book as by safe indicating that this amount was kept in the safe though in fact it was not.,FACTS
1963_S_59,on the basis of the entries in the handover book the final accounts were written up.,FACTS
1963_S_59,i opened four personal accounts in different banks including the imperial bank of india.,FACTS
1963_S_59,these amounts also used to be noted in the private note book and entered.,FACTS
1963_S_59,amounts which had been misappropriated used to be posted therein though in fact no orders were placed for any material.,FACTS
1963_S_59,it may be mentioned that subba raju used to visit visakhapatnam twice a month and check up the account books.,FACTS
1963_S_59,at that time it used to be represented to him that the amounts which were shown to be in the safe and not found therein had been sent to the bank for being deposited.,FACTS
1963_S_59,a lakh of rupees passed through that account.,FACTS
1963_S_59,amounts which were misappropriated used to find their way in this account.,FACTS
1963_S_59,a new cash book was also said to have been prepared by the conspirators with the object of covering up the misappropriations which had been made.,FACTS
1963_S_59,subba raju was not satisfied with the nature of supervision exercised by c section raju over the affairs of vesco because he used to look only at the cash book entries of the days on which he paid visits to vesco 's office to which he used to go with previous intimation.,FACTS
1963_S_59,in january 1952 he therefore brought one section g krishna aiyar who had vast experience in the maintenance of accounts of electrical undertaking 's having been chief accountant of the south madras electric supply corporation to undertake an investigation and then to act as financial adviser.,FACTS
1963_S_59,that report showed that during the period 1948 49 rs 33 271 10 0 shown as paid to the andhra power system were in fact not paid.,FACTS
1963_S_59,the interim report showed that there was a shortage of about rs 90 000 for this period.,FACTS
1963_S_59,in fact in april 1952 the collector attached vesco properties for realising this amount.,FACTS
1963_S_59,he was given time for doing so but he failed to pay it.,FACTS
1963_S_59,as a result of investigation they found that there was a total misappropriation of rs 3 40 000. on may 13 1954 a chargesheet was filed against the two respondents as well as murti and the approver ramana.,FACTS
1963_S_59,he however directed ramana to make his confession before a submagistrate.,FACTS
1963_S_59,3 irrelevant evidence was introduced and some evidence was introduced in a manner not authorised by the evidence act.,ARGUMENT
1963_S_59,p c while conducting the examination of the respondents.,ARGUMENT
1963_S_59,the evidence of the approver was inadmissible because the pardon granted to him was illegal that in any case it is unreliable was so found even by the sessions judge and must therefore be rejected.,ARGUMENT
1963_S_59,if the evidence of the approver is left out the remaining evidence would be inadequate to sustain the prosecution case.,ARGUMENT
1963_S_59,on the face of it this is a valid charge.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,the second charge is for an offence of criminal breach of trust punishable under section 409 and the accusation therein is that the two respondents along with ramana misappropriated 69 items aggregating to a little over rs 3 20 000. it is clear from the charge that some of the amounts were misappropriated between april 1947 and march 1950 some between april 1947 and march 1949 some between april 1947 and march 1951 and quite a large number between september 1947 and march 1950 and a still large number between april 1951 and march 1952. it is thus apparent that offences committed within a space of 12 months were tried along with offences committed beyond that period.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,unless therefore the provisions of section 239 are applicable it would follow that there was a misjoinder of charges.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,221 to 232 are comprised under the first sub head and sections 233 to 240 in the second.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,section 224 deals with the interpretation of the language of the charge and section 225 with the effect of errors in the charge.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,226 to 231 deal with the power of the court with regard to framing and altering charges and the procedure to be adopted at the trial where a charge is found to be defective or there is no charge or where a new charge is to be framed.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,section 232 deals with the power of the appellate court or the high court when it discovers that there is material error in the charge.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,section 233 provides that for every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,234 235 236 and 239. the first three provisions relate to the framing of charges against a single accused person.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,section 234.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,1 deals with the trial of a person for offences of the same kind not exceeding three committed within the space of 12 months from the first to the last of such offences and section 231 2 what is meant by the expression offences of the same kind.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,this provision lifts partially the ban on the trial of a person for more than one offence at the same trial.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,section 2351 however goes a step further and permits the trial of a person for more offences than one if they are so connected together as to form the same transaction.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,thus under this provision if the connection between the various offences is established the limitations placed by section 2341 both as regards the number and the period during which the offences are alleged to have been committed will not apply.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,it also permits that charges could be framed against an accused person in the alternative if the court thinks fit.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,similarly if the second respondent were alone tried on the second charge his trial would not have been open to any objection if the allegation were that the offences were so connected together as to form the same transaction.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,f there is a conjunction and.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,the opening words of the section show that it is an enabling provision and therefore the court has a discretion to avail itself cumulatively of two or more clauses.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,the concluding portion of section 239 shows that the provisions contained in the former part of chapter xix shall as far as may be apply to the charges framed with the aid of section 239. does this mean that the provisions of section 233 234 235 and 236 must also be complied with.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,it could not have been the intention of the legislature to create such a situation.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,again as already stated section 2341 does not override the provisions of section 2351 which permits trial of a person for more offences than one committed during any period provided they are so connected together as to form one transaction.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,that if there are certain restrictions with respect to the trial of a single accused there is no reason why those restrictions will disappear if an accused person is tried along with several other persons.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,a c and d of section 239 as well as that occurring in section 2351 ought to be given the same meaning according to the normal rule of construction of statutes.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,for even in the absence of those words the earlier provisions could not have been ignored.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,for it is a rule of construction that all the provisions of a statute are to be read together and given effect to and that it is therefore the duty of the court to construe a statute harmoniously.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,b says that persons accused of an offence and persons accused of abetment or of an attempt to commit such offence may also be charged and tried together.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,criminal conspiracy as defined in section 120 a and consists of an agreement to do an illegal act or an agreement to do an act which is not illegal by illegal means.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,section 120 b provides that whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with death imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term of two years or upwards shall be punishable in the same manner as if he has abetted such offence unless there was an express provision in the code for the punishment of such conspiracy.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,the idea was to prevent the commission of crimes by so to speak nipping them in the bud.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,but it does not follow that where crimes have been committed the liability to punishment already incurred under section 120 b by having entered into a criminal conspiracy is thereby wiped away.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,no doubt as already stated where offences for committing which a conspiracy was entered into have actually been committed it may not in the particular circumstances of a case be desirable to charge the offender both with the conspiracy and the offences committed in pursuance of that conspiracy.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,but that would be a matter ultimately within the discretion of the court before which the trial takes place.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,in so far as the fourth point is concerned that would have a bearing not on the form of the charge but on the credibility of the evidence bearing on the point of conspiracy.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,what it does is to make entries in books of account regularly kept in the course of business relevant in all proceedings in a court of law.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,these entries are however not by themselves sufficient to charge any person with liability.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,section 34 does not go beyond that.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,it says nothing about non existence of entries in account books.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,there is section ii of the evidence act which provides that facts not otherwise relevant are relevant if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,some of the facts in issue in this case are whether payments of certain sums of money were made to crompton engineering co and other firms or authorities.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,absence of entries in their account books would be inconsistent with the receipt of the accounts and would thus be a relevant fact which can be proved under section 11. the fact that no payments were received by those firms has been deposed to by persons connected with those firms and whose duty it was to receive and acknowledge amounts received by the firms or who were in charge of the accounts of these firms.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,for the purpose of showing that no amounts were received by the firms their account books would thus be as relevant as the vesco account books for the purpose of showing the contrary.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,it is under these provisions that the account books of the firms must be held to be relevant.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,what value to attach to them is another matter and would be for the court of fact to consider.,STATUTE
1963_S_59,further 64 documents were missing from the records when they came to the high court and that this has caused serious prejudice to the respondent.,ARGUMENT
1963_S_59,this court has pointed out in the latter decision that while it must be shown that the approver is a witness of truth the evidence adduced in a case can not be considered in compartments and that even for judging the credibility of the approver the evidence led to corroborate him in material particulars would be relevant for consideration.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,the high court should bear this in mind for deciding whether the evidence of the approver should be acted upon or not.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,then again it would not be sufficient for the high court to deal with the evidence in a general way.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,it would be necessary for it to consider for itself the evidence adduced by the prosecution on the specific charges and then to conclude whether those charges have been established or not.,ANALYSIS
1963_S_59,the prosecution would be well advised if instead of placing the evidence on each and every one of those large number of charges against the respondents it chooses to select a few charges under each head other than the head of conspiracy and concentrates on establishing those charges this would save public time and also serve the purpose of the prosecution.,ANALYSIS

2005_S_388,power of court to release certain offenders on probation of good conduct.,STATUTE
2005_S_388,the appellant would have filed the orders passed by the criminal courts convicting the respondent herein had an opportunity been given to the appellant.,ANALYSIS
2005_S_388,the high court also failed to take into consideration that the respondent has been in jail for three days and had not put in substantial period in custody.,ANALYSIS
2005_S_388,the high court vide its order impugned in this appeal has observed that there is no allegation that the respondent is a previous convict.,ANALYSIS
2005_S_388,in fact as could be seen from the annexures filed along with this appeal the respondent has been convicted for offence under sections 332 and 461 of the dmc act.,ANALYSIS
2005_S_388,since the appellant mcd was not given any opportunity by the high court to file conduct report of the respondent the order impugned in this appeal is liable to be set aside.,ANALYSIS
2005_S_388,a person whose case is based on falsehood can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the litigation.,ANALYSIS
2005_S_388,a litigant who approaches the court is bound to produce all documents which are relevant to the litigation.,ANALYSIS
2005_S_388,if he withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side then he would be guilty of playing fraud on the court as well on the opposite party.,ANALYSIS
2005_S_388,the offender can only be released on probation of good conduct under this section when the court forms an opinion having considered the circumstances of the case the nature of the offence and the character of the offender that in a particular case the offender should be released on probation of good conduct.,ANALYSIS
2005_S_388,the second respondent is a previous convict as per the records placed before us.,ANALYSIS
2005_S_388,such a previous convict can not be released in view of section 4 of the pob act.,ANALYSIS
2005_S_388,would therefore be illegal.,ANALYSIS
2005_S_388,sections 4 and 6 of the act indicate the procedure requiring the court to call for a report from the probation officer and consideration of the report and any other information available relating to the character and physical and mental condition of the offender.,ANALYSIS
2005_S_388,these facts are of primary importance before the court can pass an order under the probation of offenders act.,ANALYSIS
2005_S_388,this plea can not be entertained in this court.,ANALYSIS
2005_S_388,the appeal is accordingly allowed with costs of rs 10000 to be paid by the second respondent to the appellant as indicated in paragraph supra.,JUDGMENT
2008_P_8,allegedly on the premise that the first respondent is the proprietor of the said mark by reason of long user and thus acquired a reputation in that behalf a legal notice was issued upon it questioning its right to use the said mark in respect of centrifugal pumps by the appellant laying a claim that it had been using the said mark since 1963. respondent no 1 thereafter filed a suit in the delhi high court for grant of a decree of permanent injunction being suit no 2408 of 1985 alleging infringement of the said mark andor claiming right of passing off in respect thereof.,FACTS
2008_P_8,appellant 's counsel appeared on that date and inter alia contended that presently it was the registered owner of the trade mark which was sought to be cancelled.,ARGUMENT
2008_P_8,in view of that statement a submission was made on behalf of the first respondent that it may be permitted to withdraw the petition with liberty to file a fresh petition on the same cause of action.,ARGUMENT
2008_P_8,the second rectification application filed by the first respondent however was transferred to the intellectual property appellate board.,FACTS
2008_P_8,the said application was dismissed.,FACTS
2008_P_8,a writ petition was filed there against by the first respondent.,FACTS
2008_P_8,a learned single judge of the delhi high court however refused to stay the operation of the order of the board dated 27 10 2004 an appeal was preferred there against.,FACTS
2008_P_8,the division bench of the high court thereafter while disposing of both the writ petition and the letters patent appeal allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits.,FACTS
2008_P_8,the said order of the division bench is under challenge in this appeal.,FACTS

2008_P_8,first respondent withdrew the application against m s jain industries.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,the prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps goods so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,two interpretations thereto which are possible are 1 the said words would denote non use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer and 2 the mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,the person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,it confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,the same is an assignable right in terms of s 36 of the act whereas an unregistered trade mark is not.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,a registered proprietor of a trade mark should not be permitted to circumvent the law of user of the trade mark for a long time by assigning the same from time to time.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,but then such a case has to be made out.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,allegation of trafficking is a serious one.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,it must be proved in presence of the person against whom such allegations are made.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,at the time of grant of original registration advertisements are issued and objections are called for.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,renewal of registration in a sense also is not automatic.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,a person who had been using the said trade mark as a proprietor thereof by user is supposed to keep itself abreast with such applications filed by another either for registration of the trade mark or renewal thereof.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,the non user for a long time would disentitle a registered proprietor from renewal of the registration.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,as a person obtains a right on and from the date of registration andor renewal thereof he can ordinarily be deprived of his right unless it is shown that the assignment thereof by his holder was not a bona fide one or had been made by way of camouflage.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,if the assignee has obtained assignment for bona fide use he may not be fastened with any liability owing to non user on the part of his predecessor.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,in other words the mistake of the predecessor should not be visited with non use of the present registered owner.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,sub s 3 covers a case falling within cl b and not the cl a thereof.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,had the intention of the parliament been that sub s 3 covers cases falling under cl b and clause ahaving regard to the similarity of the expressions used there was no reason as to why it could not be stated so explicitly.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,the trade mark for which registration is obtained is used intermittently.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,such non user for a temporary period may be due to any exigency including a bar under a statute or a policy decision of the government or any action taken against the registrant.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,that the appellant was an infringer both of the right of m s jain industries as also the first respondent and thus its use was not bona fide in a case of this nature can not be accepted.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,prima facie therefore appellant has been held to be the registered owner of the trade mark.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,but it is another thing to say that the appellant could be proceeded against alone for non user of the registered trade mark for a period of more than five years.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,for the purpose of making out such a case both the original registrants as also the assignee were required to be impleaded as parties.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,the counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant did not state that it had waived its right so far as non impleadment of m s jain industries was concerned.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,it only consented for grant of liberty in favour of the first respondent for filing of an application for the self same cause of action.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,the question of maintainability of the second suit is absence of the registrant proprietor was not and could not have been the subject matter of consent at that stage.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,the cause of action which permitted the first respondent to file an application for rectification against m s jain industries was non user thereof by it.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,its non user and rectification of the register could not in the aforementioned situation have been tagged with the cause of action if any against the appellant.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,the right of a registered trade mark is not lost automatically on the expiry of five years and one month.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,it has to be adjudicated upon.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,whether the registered proprietor of the trade mark had taken recourse to trafficking or not must be determined in an appropriate proceeding.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,the principle of purchaser of a property has a duty to make enquiriestherefore cannot apply in a case of this nature.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,so long as the right to assign a registered trade mark remains valid once the same is validly assigned the assignee derives the same right as that of the assignor in terms of the statute.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,a title to a trade mark derived on assignment as provided for under the act can not be equated with a defective title acquired in any other property as admittedly on the date of assignment the right of the registered trade mark was not extinguished.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,an assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses.,ANALYSIS
2008_P_8,it is set aside accordingly.,JUDGMENT

2014_R_41,she also seems to have had a scuffle with bhavna which is apparent from the fact that her hair was found in the grip of the deceased during investigation.,ANALYSIS

2014_R_41,there was no reason for the sole eye witness anil pw 21 to implicate anybody falsely.,ANALYSIS
2014_R_41,merely because he has been some time in the company of the police at the police station his testimony can not be discarded as untrue.,ANALYSIS
2014_R_41,in any case the period between the arrest and the identification parade was not large enough to constitute inordinate delay.,ANALYSIS

2014_R_41,he became the unfortunate witness of a gruesome murder and fearlessly identified the accused in court.,ANALYSIS
2014_R_41,in his deposition he specified the details of the part which the accused played with reasonable particularity.,ANALYSIS

2010_J_55,the first respondent then filed three separate applications before the madras high court inter alia under sections 46 and 56 of the trade and merchandise marks act1958.,FACTS
2010_J_55,he contended that the ipab erred in holding that software was a service and the subject registrations were in relation to goods without considering the wide definition of goods provided under section 2g of the 1958 act.,ARGUMENT
2010_J_55,akhil sibal argued that the ipab committed grave error in relying upon the provisions of the 1999 act and the trade marks rules2002 when these provisions were not applicable as the applications were filed under the 1958 act.,ARGUMENT
2010_J_55,learned counsel would submit that in examining the question of non use under section 461bthe ipab failed to consider that the requisite use must be in relation to goods under registration which is extensively defined under section 22b of the 1958 act.,ARGUMENT
2010_J_55,he argued that the appellant has not taken the plea of the first respondent not being a person aggrieved with respect to filing of the applications for rectification before the ipab merely urging the plea that the first respondent has no locus standi in the written submissions before the ipab is not sufficient.,ARGUMENT
2010_J_55,learned counsel would submit that the appellant has for the first time argued before this court that the first respondent is not a person aggrieved andor not capable of maintaining the rectification proceedings with respect to each and every good for which the appellant has been registered since the first respondent has not been registered for all the goods.,ARGUMENT
2010_J_55,whether the application is under section 46 or under section 56 or a composite application under both sections it is a pre requisite that the applicant must be a person aggrieved.,ANALYSIS
2010_J_55,a likelihood of some injury or damage to the applicant by such trade mark remaining on the register may meet the test of locus standi.,ANALYSIS
2010_J_55,in kerly 's law of trade marks and trade names 11th edition at page 166the legal position with regard to person aggrieved has been summarized thus the persons who are aggrieved are all persons who are in some way or the other substantially interested in having the mark removed where it is a question of removal from the register including all persons who would be substantially damaged if the mark remained and all trade rivals over whom an advantage was gained by a trader who was getting the benefit of a registered trade mark to which he was not entitled.,ANALYSIS
2010_J_55,the phrase has been variously construed depending on the context in which it occurs.,ANALYSIS
2010_J_55,three sections viz sections 4656 and 69 of the act contain the phrase.,ANALYSIS
2010_J_55,section 46 deals with the removal of a registered trade mark from the register on the ground of non use.,ANALYSIS
2010_J_55,this section presupposes that the registration which was validly made is liable to be taken off by subsequent non user.,ANALYSIS
2010_J_55,section 56 on the other hand deals with situations where the initial registration should not have been or was incorrectly made.,ANALYSIS
2010_J_55,but if the ground for rectification is merely based on non user i e under section 46 of the act that is not really on account of any public mischief by way of an incorrect entry.,ANALYSIS
2010_J_55,the non user does not by itself render the entry incorrect but it gives a right to a person whose interest is affected to apply for its removal.,ANALYSIS
2010_J_55,addisons application was one under section 46 and the test to determine whether the applicant was a person aggrieved within the meaning of that section should have been the one laid down by romer j in wright case and not the one propounded by the house of lords in the matter of powell 's trade mark.,ANALYSIS
2010_J_55,in the first place when the first respondent applied for rectification removal in respect of three registrations in classes 79 and 16it must have shown in respect of each of them that it is a person aggrieved and the ipab must have separately considered in respect of each registration the locus standi of the first respondent as the considerations for each entry might not have been common.,ANALYSIS
2010_J_55,this is so because the pre requisite for exercise of power under section 461 is that the applicant is a person aggrieved.,ANALYSIS
2010_J_55,in view of the above these appeals are allowed in part and the impugned order dated september 92004 is set aside.,JUDGMENT
